However, the reverse is now the case because the colonial masters have placed the president and governors above the traditional rulers.</p><p>Egbe stated that Obasanjo might have been right when he pointed out that the monarchs ought to stand up for the governor, but he should not have humiliated them in public.</p><p>According to him, “It is the practical manifestation of the negative impact of colonialism. In the precolonial era, our traditional institution was highly functional while our traditional rulers were highly revered and venerated.</p><p>“They were regarded as supreme and next to the gods. It was so well structured that the rulers understood very clearly what leadership was. However, with the coming of the colonialists, the traditional rulers lost that venerated position. Few reasons can be blamed for this.</p><p>“One, the traditional rulers were used as tools by the colonialists. The traditional institution was destroyed and the powers of the kings were also destroyed along with it. In the post-colonial era, power was handed over to a democratically elected government.</p><p>“At this point, the democratically elected government emanated from the colonialists. So, the traditional institution in the post-colonial era also suffered the same fate it suffered during colonial rule such that the constitution of Nigeria placed the elected officials higher than the traditional rulers.</p><p>“So to this extent, given the constitutional provisions of the powers of the president and the governors, the traditional rulers find themselves under the rulership of the president and the governors.</p><p>“In other words, when they are at formal ceremonies as they were in Oyo State, traditional rulers are supposed to stand up and respect the position of the governor and the president.</p><p>“From this perspective, we could say former President Obasanjo was right to have pointed out that the kings needed to stand up in honour of the governor. However, Obasanjo was wrong and very insulting to have reproached, commanded and humiliated these royal fathers in public and in the manner he did.</p><p>“You could see that the Obas were scared and they stood up like primary school children immediately. That was a rude command to royal fathers. He could have allowed the matter to die down after reproaching them instead of ordering them to stand up after the reprimand.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH16e5FtZqiakaiur7bOZq6aq12ntqi002auoZ2eYrWmec%2BooKeslZl6sMHTZquhmaRivLq7jKamp5mimLW0edKhpq6klGLAta3NnWSuqF2bvLN506GcZp%2Bfq7Kzus6rZJ6fkpp8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./282804-waziri-wa-elimu-aanzisha-likizo-fupi-ya-siku-5-kwa-wanafunzi-wa-shule-za-msingi-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Waziri wa elimu aanzisha likizo fupi ya siku 5 kwa wanafunzi wa shule za msingi</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-burns-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Burns - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
