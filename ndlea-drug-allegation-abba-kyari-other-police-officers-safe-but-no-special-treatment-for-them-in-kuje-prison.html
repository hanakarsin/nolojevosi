head of the IGP Intelligence Response Team (IRT), DCP Abba Kyari would come to no harm in prison custody, officials have assured.</h2><p>The assurance was given by the Public Relations Officer of the Federal Capital Territory Command of the Nigerian Correctional Service, <strong>Mr. Chukwuedo Humphrey </strong>who confirmed that <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Abba Kyari</a></strong> and others have been received in Kuje prison facility.</p><p>He added however that no one is afforded special treatment while in custody and the case of Kyari and others with him won’t be different.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports&nbsp;<strong>Justice Emeka Nwike</strong> of the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Monday <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>ordered the transfer</a></strong> of Kyari and six others to the Kuje Correctional Center.</p><p>The suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police and six others are currently facing charges of drug trafficking.</p><p>The Judge in his ruling directed the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>National Drug Law Enforcement Agency</a></strong>, (NDLEA), to transfer Kyari and other defendants to prison custody.</p><p>This comes shortly after Kyari and others in the drug trafficking case were denied bail.</p><p>Other police officers denied bail by the court and ordered to be transferred to prison custody are ACP Sunday Ubia, Inspector Simon Agirgba, Inspector John Nuhu, and James Bawa.</p><p>But shortly after the order, concerns were raised about <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>the safety of the officers</a></strong> in prison as some people observed that they may be targets for those they have sent to prison before their own ordeal began.</p><p>But reacting to the concerns raised, Mr. Humphrey said there is nothing to be worried about as Kyari and others with him are very safe and no harm will come to them.</p><p>He added that prison officials are very professional in their duties and have the backup of other security agencies including the police and DSS in ensuring everything goes fine.</p><p>The PRO said “The case is a normal procedure for us. He is being kept where awaiting trials persons are and his co- Defendants as well. We are surprised that someone said he is not safe. How can someone say the facility is not safe…is it in his house that the inmates would be safe?</p><p>“The facility is a safe facility, we have all the security apparatus here, the army is there, the police, the DSS and our men. So if anyone is saying the facility is not safe…is it from internal incursion of external incursion. We are here as professionals and we will do our jobs to the best of our ability.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5JpZqecnJqubrDRrp5mmZyhsqit06Kmp2WRl6%2BiecqymKuhXaTBqbHRZqeopJmYsm67xZ%2BgnJ2iqHq0rcWeZJutpGK7sHnSqZycoZGherW%2BxJqrpp2eqXqnu9Fmq6GdnWK2r3nKrqGeZaCntrS7zWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1383149-jj-rawlings-photos-beautifully-show-4-children-late-ghanaian-president-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>JJ Rawlings: Photos show 4 children of late Ghanaian president</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./virtual-assistant-fails.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>13 Times Siri and Alexa Were Horribly Wrong</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
