other national revenues and cannot transfer his incompetence and failure to other Tiers of Government which have no control over national security, fiscal and monetary policies, which mismanagement by President Tinubu’s government has crippled our economy.</p><p>“Moreover, State Governors have no control over the pervading corruption and continuing monumental treasury-looting under President Tinubu who has failed to take concrete measures to curb the malaise.</p><p>“It is an assault on the sensibility of Nigerians that instead of charging the government it formed to live up to its billings, the APC is seeking a sordid and depraved approach to divert public attention from its failures.</p><p>“From its diversionary statement, it is clear that the APC is jittery and afraid that it has been exposed following revelations and reports in the public space that its leaders are involved in multiple scams and fraudulent deals through which they continue to siphon funds meant for the wellbeing of the people resulting in the unbearable hardship being experienced by Nigerians today.</p><p>“The complicity of the APC leaders apparently informs why they have remained silent in the face of the incompetence, monumental treasury-looting and corruption in the Tinubu administration.</p><p>“Our Party counsels President Tinubu and the APC to face their self-inflicted woes and heed the patriotic call of the PDP governors who are providing quality leadership with life-enhancing projects and programmes in their various States in line with the people-oriented manifesto and policy thrust of the PDP.</p><p>“It is evident today across Nigeria that it is only PDP governors and other PDP elected public officials that are commissioning legacy and life-enriching projects and programmes with which they are repositioning their States and various constituencies into Oases of Development.”</p><p>The party urged Nigerians to continue to hold the APC and President Tinubu solely responsible for the suffering they face.</p><p>It added, “The PDP will not hesitate to name APC leaders allegedly involved in the continuing treasury-plundering as the APC must not be allowed to “grab, snatch and run” with our national patrimony at the expense of millions of our citizens.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FpZpqok2LBqrrUm6xmpJGYuG6vwKmYnKGkrnqku8ypnK2dnpiybsDOZqOemZRiu6qzxKugmmWgmb1w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./coley-laffoon-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Coley Laffoon - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-is-instagram-showing-old-posts.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Is Instagram Showing Old Posts?
