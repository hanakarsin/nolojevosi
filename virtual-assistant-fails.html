But nobody's perfect, not even artificial intelligence. Whether they can't understand what we've said or are simply stumped, sometimes our virtual assistants can offer up some confusing and hilarious results. Here are 13 times virtual assistants were absolutely no help at all.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Remind me not to eat at their house.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: @jeannesun</a></figure><p>Alexa, quick question: I know Amazon sells pretty much everything, but who the hell is selling poop? And who would want to buy it?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Hint hint.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram @bmwallace74</a></figure><p>I've heard of a biological clock ticking, but this is a whole new ballpark. Or, you know, Alexa just misheard "bay leaves" as "babies."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Close enough.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter @CBethAnderson</a></figure><p>Sometimes it's clear what you were *trying* to remind yourself to do... even if what Siri hears is total nonsense.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Interesting, yes...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram @xenadanielle</a></figure><p>...but helpful? Not so much. This user asked how long it takes to cook baby back ribs and instead got some interesting trivia about 18th century British explorer James Cook.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Alexa needs to take a music history class.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram @bowes77</a></figure><p>When this Alexa user asked about the first hip hop song, she spat out some facts about a ditty by The Doors. Granted, the song technically has a spoken word section in the middle, but there's not a single music historian who would classify that as hip hop.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Double fail.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram @petergosik</a></figure><p>Not only did Siri completely misunderstand what this gentleman was saying —&nbsp;he was asking where the closest FedEx is — but it took "Hucks" and turned it into "hunks." That's a completely different kind of package delivery service, Siri.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">I like the way you're thinking, Alexa.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram @nancebear</a></figure><p>Apparently this shopper was trying to request "ketchup" be added to the grocery list. IDK, I wouldn't exactly be mad if I got Brad Pitt instead.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Good luck with that.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter @yipe</a></figure><p>This sleepy dad tried to set a reminder to "feed the baby," and instead got a suggestion that 2 a.m. is the time to vanquish your infant. Also, &nbsp;don't babies come equipped with a built-in "reminder" function already without bringing Alexa into it?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Sassy and not at all helpful.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter @missjplusk</a></figure><p>This user was actually asking where they could find "beer" near here. Clearly, Siri heard otherwise, but instead of actually answering where one might find an appropriate place to "get weird," the sassy assistant insisted she's "just trying to help you." How exactly, Siri? Where can we get weird?!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Don't crib off Alexa...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram @iamthemouth</a></figure><p>We've seen stories of kids using Alexa to cheat on their homework. Well, based on this answer to a question about U.S. geography, I wouldn't recommend it. When asked for the state capitals, it gave Berlin and Beijing among the answers. And while Washington, D.C. is the capital of the country, it doesn't belong to any state. Two out of five correct answers definitely wouldn't earn you a passing grade.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Wow, Amazon really has everything...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram @mjolin63</a></figure><p>If you ever questioned whether there is a higher power, Alexa seems to be confirming not only the existence of God but that you can have her sent to your house with free two-day shipping.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Well, that's a relief.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter @JasonManford</span></figure><p>On the one hand, it's a bummer that Alexa misunderstoof this user's command. On the other, I'm super glad she didn't start playing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate Smith</a> songs.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">An Alexa fail every parent can relate to.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter @JasonDavenigno</a></figure><p>Has there every been a more accurate portrayal of what it means to be the parent of a toddler? Every waking moment is spent either keeping them entertained or keeping them from certain death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfq7azwNSao2aZo6i2tMDAp6tmnpGeubQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ndlea-drug-allegation-abba-kyari-other-police-officers-safe-but-no-special-treatment-for-them-in-kuje-prison.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Abba Kyari, Other Police Officers Safe But No Special Treatment For Them In Kuje Prison</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tiktok-voice-changer.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The New Voice Changer on TikTok Lets You Change Your Voice Completely Here's How to Use It</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
