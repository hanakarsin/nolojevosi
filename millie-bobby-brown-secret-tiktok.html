So, does Millie have a secret TikTok account? Here's what we know so far.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by @milliebobbybrown</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Millie Bobby Brown hinted at her secret TikTok through an Instagram post.</h2><p>On March 18, 2021, Millie took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to post another one of her signature selfies. The difference with this one? It was accompanied by a video that showcases her doing a TikTok dance to We Don’t Play That, a viral hit on the app by The Real Boy 2021.</p><p>The video predominantly showcases the TikTok logo, meaning that Millie seemingly recorded the dance on the app and then saved the finished video to her phone to share on Instagram. Putting those pieces together, it's safe to assume that Millie is using a secret TikTok account to avoid the public spectacle of her previous one.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What's Millie's secret TikTok account's handle? She's totally hiding it this time around.</h2><p>The young star is handling this foray into TikTok much differently than her last, however. A prominent public figure on the app last time she used it, Millie purposely hid the username attached to the video she posted this time. This is clearly indicative of her having made a new secret TikTok account with a likely obscure username that fans will never find.</p><p>Back in November 2020, <a href=#>Millie deleted her first TikTok account</a> much to the sadness of fans. Although she didn't give an exact reason why at the time, she posted a quote to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> story directly after. "Realising that surrounding yourself with positivity is the happiest way of living! No hate & only love. Remember to be kind… THANK YOU X," the Stranger Things star said to fans.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>that video mills posted of them dancing is a tiktok song... do millie and noah have secret tiktoks someone fIND THEM</p>— anna ‎⧗ | HAPPY TFATWS DAY (@spideychele) <a href=#>November 18, 2019</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Some fans are starting to believe that the entire 'Stranger Things' cast has secret TikTok accounts.</h2><p>Given that Millie's costar, Sadie Sink, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a> a video that made it seem as though the same situation was transpiring with her, fans are beginning to believe that secret TikTok accounts are just a trend amongst the Stranger Things cast.</p><p>Aside from Millie and Sadie, fans are also insinuating that Noah Schnapp may also have a secret TikTok account. Of course, none of this information has been confirmed, but given the social posts by Millie and Sadie it's surely a fair assumption to make.</p><p>With the constant pressure young actors often face and the prevalence of toxic behavior on many social media apps including TikTok, it's no wonder that the megastars have opted to now use the app in secret amongst each other.</p><p>Eager fans looking to get a glimpse into the secret accounts of their favorite stars are just going to have to keep their eyes peeled for any more clues as to how to find out what the star's accounts may be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforatuMieZJunkpfGbq7RqK6nZaOasLOx02aroqOkpLg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./424018-radio-host-anthony-ndiema-frustrated-home-2am-due-traffic-mombasa-road-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Radio Host Anthony Ndiema Frustrated after Getting Home at 2am Due to Traffic Jam on Mombasa Road</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./maisie-williams-tech-startup.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Maisie Williams Has a Tech Startup Here's Everything to Know About It</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
