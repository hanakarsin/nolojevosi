– the suspended Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal, Ilorin Division, Justice Mohammed Ladan Tsamiya, who was picked up in Sokoto; Justice Adeniyi Ademola (Federal High Court); the Chief Judge of Enugu State, Justice I. A. Umezulike; Justice Kabiru Auta of Kano State High Court; and Justice Muazu Pindiga (Gombe State High Court).</p><p>The source said: <i>“Corruption in the Judiciary was based on our intelligence gathering and alerts from informants and petitions. It is not based on the perception of Nigerians. We have been on the trail of some of these judges in the last few months.</i></p><p><i>“For instance, we started probing one of the seven judges in detention since the Ramadan period of 2015. When we got sufficient intelligence on him, bordering on over N500million bribe, we invited him.</i></p><p><i>“The judge was given a copy of our report on him. By the time he read it halfway, he prostrated, held the legs of the security chief (Lawan Daura) and begged for forgiveness. We captured the way he was reeling on the floor.</i></p><p><i>We later sent a security brief on him to the National Judicial Council (NJC) with enough evidence. But he was cleared by the NJC as having committed no wrong. Since the NJC could not do the needful, we have decided to subject him to a judicial process.</i></p><p><i>“We also have a case of one of the judges who refused to unlock a safe in his house when our operatives went to his house. We may actually secure the leave of the court to relocate the safe to Abuja.</i></p><p><i>“Another detained judge got a contract from Bauchi state Government and obtained a loan from a bank. But when he defaulted in paying back the facility, the bank filed an action against him before the Federal High Court in Bauchi. What is the business of a judge with contract?”</i></p><p>Another source gave insights into the ongoing operation against 15 judges by the DSS.</p><p><i>“We are digging more and getting fresh revelations from these judges. For instance, a Federal High Court judge in detention actually spread the N54million and $171,779 recovered from his residence in different rooms. He kept them in different parts of the rooms like a thief.”</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Revealed: The real truth behind Obasanjo, Oba Akiolu feud</p><p><i>“There is no immunity conferred on judges, we are only duty bound to protect the court because it is a sacred place, a temple of justice. Once you have issues, you go to court but immediately a judge is outside the court, he or she is like you and me.</i></p><p><i>“There is nothing unusual about the arrest of judges other than it has not been the practice. But it is normal. Once a petition is lodged, it is normal that you just have to look into it as a security agency.”</i></p><p><i>“We have started looking into allegations against some banks; we have torn all banks apart. Some bank chiefs have been coming to the DSS office in Abuja for clarifications on some transactions we are investigating.</i></p><p><i>“Every week, not less than three bank officials come here. We will let you know the outcome soon.”</i></p><p>Meanwhile, the federal government has dropped plans to arraign alleged corrupt judges arrested in a DSS raid at the weekend.</p><p>According to Sahara reporters, it is not clear why the judges are not going to be arraigned again even as Nigerians remain deeply divided over the raid on their homes between late Friday, October 7 and early Saturday, October 8</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnF8lHJvcmWean1xuYysmpqmlJa5brbUnZ6eZZOWwqi002abrKtdmMK0wM6dsGasn6murbjYZqqhmZ2as7a4jaGrpqQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-do-you-get-for-winning-the-masters.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Masters Tournament Winner Takes Home Millions But How Much, Exactly?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ipob-threatens-buhari-govt-gives-fg-deadline-to-release-nnamdi-kanu.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>IPOB Threatens Buhari Govt, Gives FG Deadline To Release Nnamdi Kanu</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
