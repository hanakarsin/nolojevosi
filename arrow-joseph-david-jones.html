(EXCLUSIVE)</h1>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jYKDjX hHZJHw">Gabrielle Bernardini</a><p class="sc-bxLYvs cnDLfX">Updated March 8 2021, 12:33 p.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The CW</span></figure><p>Will he save his city… and the universe? The final season of <a href=#>Arrow</a> has officially kicked off and Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) aka the Green Arrow is on a mission with the Monitor (LaMonica Garrett) to prevent the upcoming Crisis from happening, knowing that he will ultimately have to sacrifice himself to save billions across the universe. “The only way that this is bearable for me is if I am certain my sacrifice, my death, will protect the people I love,” Oliver states in the final Season 8 trailer. &nbsp;</p><p>Fans can expect to see many familiar faces return in the final 10 episodes of the series. “It’s going to be about bringing back people from the past, bringing back all of these different elements in the story,” Joseph David-Jones, who plays Connor Hawke, exclusively told Distractify. “They really want to give fans, especially the ones who have been watching religiously from the beginning, an enjoyable experience as a way to sort of send off the show.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The CW</span></figure><p>So, what can die-hard fans expect in the final episodes of the superhero series? Distractify spoke with Joseph about his character’s developing storyline, the upcoming Crisis, and the future of the Arrowverse in an exclusive interview. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Joseph David-Jones talks about Connor’s relationship with Mia and his brother J.J. on Arrow.</h2><p>Last season, fans were introduced to Connor in a time jump sequence known as “flash forwards.” In 2040, Connor has teamed up with Oliver and Felicity’s daughter Mia Smoak (Kat McNamara), to keep an eye on her, which fans learned was an order from his adoptive father John Diggle. Joseph spoke with us about his developing relationship with Mia and the Arrow kids learning to be part of a team.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The CW</span></figure><p>“With her being raised in isolation, I was kind of the first person she opened up to and then finding out so much that she didn’t know about me (aka that he knew her identity), so much of my backstory that was sort of hidden, she sort of closed off,” he explained. “She’s having growing pains, working as part of the team and still trying to figure out who is going to lead this team.”&nbsp;</p><p>The actor added, “But, it’s still like a love-hate thing going on between us, so we shall see how fans respond to how we grow closer together.” Another relationship that fans will get to see develop on-screen is between Connor and his brother John Diggle Jr. aka J.J. (Charlie Barnett), who we know is the leader of the Deathstroke Gang. Joseph teased that fans will get to learn more about Connor’s backstory and the rift with his brother.&nbsp;</p><p>“Losing [JJ] is something that you instantly feel is still weighing on Connor and weighing on his family,” he told Distractify, revealing that episode 2 of Arrow will have “some pretty heavy scenes” between the brothers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The CW</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Joseph David-Jones teases upcoming Crisis on Infinite Earths in Arrowverse.</h2><p>The timeline across the Arrowverse has set in motion the upcoming Crisis on Infinite Earths, which will crossover the characters from Arrow, Supergirl, The Flash, Batwoman, and Legends of Tomorrow. While Joseph couldn’t give too much away in fear of spoiling any plot points, he did reveal that everything will change in the DC Universe following this war. &nbsp;</p><p>“It’s our Endgame,” he said, referencing Marvel’s 2019 Avengers blockbuster film. “Shows are going to be different. Main characters are going to be different. There’s a lot that’s going to change in the Arrowverse.” Well, we surely can’t wait to watch it all unfold.&nbsp;</p><p>Catch new episodes of Arrow on Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET on The CW.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2Bzu9ZmoairlaW1brDAr6CdZZqku6a%2F</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cameroon-welcome-back-aboubakar-njie-ahead-of-2023-afcon-clash-with-nigeria.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cameroon Welcome Back Aboubakar, Njie Ahead Of 2023 AFCON Clash With Nigeria</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-does-my-alexa-have-a-yellow-ring.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Does It Mean if Your Amazon Alexa Device Is Flashing or Blinking Different Colors?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
