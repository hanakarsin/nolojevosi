Let's discuss the deets.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Apple TV Plus</span></figure><p>Your mom's favorite deliciously swoon-worthy actor — aka <a href=#>Jason Momoa</a> (<a href=#>Game of Thrones</a>) — just can't stay away from dystopian drama series. The beloved star has graced our screens as Baba Voss, the leader of the Alkenny Tribe, in <a href=#>Apple TV Plus</a>'s series <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">See</a>. "In the far future, humankind has lost its sense of sight. Jason Momoa stars as the father of twins born with the mythic ability to see — who must protect his tribe against a threatened queen," the synopsis reads.</p><p>With a Rotten Tomatoes score of 63 percent, See has skated along for three seasons — the third installment premiering on Aug. 26, 2022. And the third season will officially be See's last, but why? Were the reviews not strong enough? We know Jason Momoa has no problem carrying a story. Let's discuss what led to See's demise.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Apple TV Plus</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is Apple TV Plus's 'See' ending?</h2><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, Season 2 of See became Apple TV Plus's "most watched returning drama series in the first two weeks after release," which is a small victory for a big series. And while Season 2 saw higher viewership than Season 1 during this timeframe, it may not have been enough to save the show. With this being said, no official reason for See's wrap-up has been released as of yet.</p><p>“We are thrilled to share this epic final chapter of See, which delivers all the intense drama, riveting action, and heartfelt emotion fans have come to expect, as well as what we think is a deeply satisfying conclusion to our story,” showrunner and executive producer Jonathan Tropper stated, as detailed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>.</p><p>“Building a world without sight was a particularly unique and continuous challenge that was met through the passionate and thoughtful collaboration of a phenomenally talented and diverse team both in front of and behind the camera. The show has been a monumental labor of love for all involved, and we are eternally grateful for the way See has been embraced by viewers around the world,” he continued.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>We will point out that Jonathan Tropper — who seems to be quite outspoken about his darling series — posted an emotional <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram essay</a> of sorts back in November 2021, hinting at See's end.</p><p>"Wrapping a season of production is always emotional — like moving out of a home full of family and memories. Wrapping two back-to-back seasons even more so," he wrote.</p><p>"Today we shot our last shot- a simple blue screen insert of this beautiful baby. In between, the world changed and our lives changed with it, but we somehow still managed to shoot two seasons (16 episodes) of this gigantic show," he continued.</p><p>"In the end, even with all the new protocols and restrictions, the work is still the work, and for that we are all eternally grateful. The journey, as always, is really about the people you come to know and love along the way."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jonathan Tropper (@tropperj)</a></p></figure><p>Listen, it's more than possible Jonathan Tropper is just a highly sensitive guy, but considering the passion that went into this post, we think he knew something regarding the closing of See back in November 2021.</p><p>The first episode of See Season 3 is currently streaming on Apple TV Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZKydlWKusbzLnmStrl2au6W1zaA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./paul-of-psqure-flaunts-young-lover-after-messy-break-up-with-ex-wife-anita.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Paul Of Psquare Flaunts Young Lover After Messy Break Up With Ex-wife, Anita</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./simi-dismisses-pregnancy-speculations.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Singer, Simi Dismisses Pregnancy Speculations</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
