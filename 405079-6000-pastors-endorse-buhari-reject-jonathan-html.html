the emergence of Major General Muhammadu Buhari as president in the forthcoming elections, while rejecting President Goodluck Jonathan.</strong></p><p>According to them, they were acting by divine intervention from God who told them that Buhari would be the next president of Nigeria, pointing out that they were not bribed by anybody to support Buhari, PM News reports.</p><p>The pastors under the aegis of Christians for Governance, Pastors For Change have also declared seven days praying and fasting for God to grant the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate victory at the poll.</p><p>The pastors, drawn from various churches, such as the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, Catholic, Orthodox, among others have openly endorsed Buhari and Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, his running mate at a news conference in Ikeja, Lagos.</p><p>Addressing the news conference, Bishop Kayode Williams, National Coordinator, Christians for Good Governance, said: “<i>We want to observe seven days of special prayer on the seven mountains in the Southwest political zones comprising six states to pray for the victory of Buhari and Osinbajo in the 28 March presidential election.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>Northern Youths Back Jonathan, Reject Buhari</a></p><p><i>“We are using this opportunity to call on all pastors who believe that the time has surely come for change in Nigeria to exhort, mobilise, instruct and direct all our members from our churches, numbering 186,000 churches in the Southwest zone to adhere to this divine instruction from God.</i></p><p><i>“We shall intensify our intercessory prayers to God so that there will be peace in the nation and that the election will be free, transparent and peaceful. We are asking our archbishops, evangelists, elders, deacons and deaconesses to join hands and make sure that the prayer programme is very successful</i>.”</p><p>He noted that the present leadership had failed the nation, adding that Nigerians had hoped for improvement in various sectors but nothing has been done and that is why the group is calling for change.</p><p>“<i>No one can do the same thing and expect different result. Nigerians must therefore get a change in baton. It appears that many people at the top do not feel what an ordinary Nigerian feels: No job, no money, no light, health problem, sorrow and frustration everyday due to massive corruption at the top. All these must change. Nigerians deserve good life in the midst of all the resources that God has endowed us with</i>,” Williams stated.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>I Didn’t Get Out Of Jonathan's Largesse, Edo Cleric Says</a></p><p>Speaking on the N7 billion bribery allegation against the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), he denied knowledge of any money collected, but added that every rumour has an element of truth.</p><p>The movement is being supported by Rev. Moses Iloh, Archbishop Magnus Atilade, Ayo Opadokun and many other bigwigs in Christendom.</p><p>In February 2015, the Rivers State Governor, R<a href=#>otimi Amaechi, had alleged that the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) bribed some Christian leaders with N6bn</a> to campaign against Buhari. This was trailed by controversies. A pastor named Kallamu Musa Dikwa, who claimed to be the Executive Director, Voice of Northern Christian Movement, also <a href=#>alleged that some pastors received the sum of N 7 billion,</a> and not N 6 billion said by Gov Amaechi.</p><p><a href=#>CAN however debunked these allegations</a>, saying it is a complete lie and just one of the many evil plots to dent the image of CAN’s leadership as well as to rubbish its integrity.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bishop Emmah Isong, Chairman, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) in Cross River State also accused Director General (DG) of the APC presidential campaign council, <a href=#>Governor Amaechi of bribing 500 pastors</a> to support Gen.
