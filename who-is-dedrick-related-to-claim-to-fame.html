Among this season's cast is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dedrick</a>, who, like his castmates, is vying for that $100,000 grand prize. Well, he was anyway, until he was surprisingly eliminated in the Aug. 7 episode.</p><p>Ahead of Dedrick's elimination, there was a lot of speculation on who he is related to. And now that we know who his famous relative is (or, Dedrick's case, multiple relatives), let's take a look at the clues that got us here.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney/Chris Willard</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Dedrick from 'Claim to Fame' is related to Michael Jackson!</h2><p>While Dedrick's famous family connection was once a tantalizing mystery, we now know that Dedrick is related to none other than the King of Pop himself, Michael Jackson. Dedrick's father is Sigmund Esco "Jackie" Jackson, and Dedrick's real name is Sigmund Esco Jackson, Jr. Dedrick is sent packing in the Aug. 7 episode when he incorrectly guesses who Adam is related to.</p><p>Leading up to Season 3 of Claim to Fame, the cast spilled some secrets — two truths and a lie — about their celebrity relatives.</p><p>Dedrick's are as follows:</p><ul><li>My celebrity relative is my: Uncle</li><li>My celebrity relative is best known for being a: Singer</li><li>The biggest award my celebrity relative has won: Best Rock Song</li></ul><p>We now know that the third clue was the lie.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Claim To Fame (@claimtofameabc)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Some fans thought Dedrick's celebrity relative might be Smokey Robinson, Luther Vandross, or Michael Jackson.</h2><p>Ahead of his elimination, the guesses for Dedrick's celebrity relative included <a href=#>Smokey Robinson</a>, Luther Vandross, and Michael Jackson.</p><p>Smokey Robinson is an iconic R&B and soul singer, songwriter, and record producer. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and received the 2016 Library of Congress Gershwin Prize. He holds two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one as a solo artist and another with The Miracles.

During his career, he earned 11 consecutive RIAA-certified platinum albums and sold more than 40 million records globally. On July 1, 2005, Luther passed away at JFK Medical Center in Edison, N.J., due to complications from a stroke. He was 54 years old.</p><p>And last but certainly not least, <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a>, aka the King of Pop, was a celebrated singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. His influence on music, dance, and fashion, alongside his <a href=#>complex personal life</a>, solidified his status as a global icon.
