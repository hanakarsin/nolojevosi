The drama of watching individuals survive some of the harshest conditions known to man for as long as they can is riveting, but plenty of other shows do this too. History Channel’s Alone takes the premise one step further by having contestants brave the wilderness all by themselves.</p><p>Survival shows are meant to test the skills of the contestants but on Alone, no one knows how the other contestants are faring in the game, which makes it an impressive test of resilience and stamina as well. So, in the nine seasons of the show, which contestants have managed to last the longest?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: History</span><p>Pre-approved gear contestants can use on 'Alone'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">What has been the longest stay on 'Alone'?</h2><p>Alone has been on the air since 2015 and the show doesn’t get any easier for the intrepid individuals who choose to compete and self-document their daily struggles while trying to survive in extreme locations. But each season gives fans plenty to talk about when it comes to the show’s daring and dangerous challenges.</p><p>The adventure reality game show tests the survival skills of its contestants by having them fend for themselves for as long as they can in the wilderness, with <a href=#>10 pre-approved tools to help them with their everyday tasks</a>. With so many contestants having participated in this grueling competition since its inception, fans are curious to know which one of them has lasted the longest.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>, Season 7’s Roland Welker comes out at the top with exactly 100 days spent in the wilderness by himself, before he was crowned the winner of that season and awarded the largest cash prize in the show’s history of $1 million. After growing up in the mountains of Shiloh, Penn., Roland had dedicated his entire life to “an existence of an all-season subsistence hunter/trapper,” so it was little surprise when this highly accomplished survivalist won out against the other contestants.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: History</span><p>Season 7 Winner Roland Welker</p></figure><p>These days, the self-titled “Last Bushman” offers fans a chance to go on a hunt with him. All you have to do is fill out your information on his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> and he will get back to you. He also hosted the “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lets Get Woodsy Survival Camp</a>" in 2021, but it’s unclear if he plans to host another one.</p><p>The runner-up to hold the title of longest days spent on Alone goes to Season 7's Callie Russell. After surviving 89 days on the shores of Great Slave Lake in Canada, the survivalist was pulled out by the show's medical team after she was found to have frostbite. Fans loved Callie for her positive attitude throughout her time on the show. Even when her toe was turning purple, she cheered it on saying, "Come on, toe."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: History</span><p>Callie Russell</p></figure><p>Coming in third place is Season 8’s Zachary Fowler. Zachary spent 87 days alone in the wilderness of Patagonia in South America. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bangor Daily News</a>, when Zachary entered the competition, he was a “husky” 223 pounds, but by the time he was on the helicopter going home, he was 70 pounds lighter, weighing in at 153 pounds.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: History</span><p>Zachary Fowler</p></figure><p>Alone airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. on the History Channel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobyvs8Ssq2arpJbGbrvNZpilp56a</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./anambra-decides-ipob-has-proven-its-not-a-terrorist-organisation-doyin-okupe.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>IPOB Has Proven Its Not A Terrorist Organisation Doyin Okupe</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gretchen-hirsch-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gretchen Hirsch - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
