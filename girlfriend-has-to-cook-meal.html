This Man Wants His Girlfriend to Cook a Meal to Appease His Family</h1>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-dSnYFs eqMhYP">Distractify Staff</a><p class="sc-hYRTcE cWmyoM">Jun. 12 2023, Published 5:16 p.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Some folks got the game twisted! Most people would agree that they’d want to make a good impression when meeting their partner’s family for the first time — from being polite and pleasant to showcasing their down-to-earth personality.</p><p>However, finding out that making a good impression requires you to compromise on your morals and beliefs can easily be a dealbreaker for people. And it looks like a <a href=#>Reddit</a> user asking his <a href=#>girlfriend to cook</a> a meal with his female family members was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Here’s the 4-1-1.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Stock photo</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">A Reddit user says that his girlfriend has to help cook a meal to make a good impression on his family.</h2><p>On Reddit’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“Am I the A------" (AITA) forum</a>, a user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a> that he asked his girlfriend to uphold a “sexist tradition” in hopes of making a good impression.</p><p>The user shared that it’s common practice for the women in his family to cook a meal for a huge family dinner.</p><p>“I have a big family that’s incredibly close," the user wrote. "We have big family dinners every few months where we all meet at my great-grandfather's estate and eat together. Typically how this works is that the women go cook for the time they’re there and the men don’t. I am fully aware it’s sexist as hell. That said, I am one of the youngest people in the family and my protests mean literally nothing."</p><p>The user noted that when new women opt out of cooking, they are often ostracized by the family. He also added that women who don’t cook have already established a good relationship with the family.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>AITA for begging my girlfriend to uphold a sexist tradition just so she can make a good first impression?</a><br>by <a href=#>u/GraveYardSchift</a> in <a href=#>AmItheAsshole</a></figure><p>He went on to say that he’s been begging his girlfriend to follow the tradition and participate in cooking a meal. His girlfriend was initially on board for the dinner; however, when he explained the cooking dynamic, she was bothered.</p><p>“She told me that it’s unacceptable and that if she has to do that she will not be going," the Redditor wrote. "I’ve tried to find a compromise with her on this but she won’t budge and she’s pissed at me. She told me that if I think it’s acceptable to make her do this I’m just as bad as everyone else, while my point is that she needs to make a good first impression,” the user shared right before asking "AITA?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Reddit users are reading the user for filth in the comment section.</h2><p>While most people understand that family tradition is important, many people believe that the user is more concerned about his girlfriend’s behavior as opposed to his family’s.</p><p>“YTA [You’re the a------] mainly because you seem to be very concerned with your girlfriend making a good first impression on your family, but not at all concerned with your family making a good first impression," one commenter wrote. "It reads as though you care far more that your family approves of your choice than you do that she approves of your family. That's pretty f----- up and self-centered,” one user shared.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Stock photo</p></figure><p>“YTA. Playing along with sexism just perpetuates it,” another person chimed in.</p><p>Truth be told, it’s understandable that the user wants his family to like his girlfriend. However, if he knows that she doesn’t come from a similar background or would have a problem with this, he may want to re-evaluate if they are compatible.</p><p>After all, most people would agree that no one should feel like they have to go against who they are to appease their partner’s family.</p><p>What do you think — was this guy in the wrong?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLazuMWroJ6mlGK1or%2BMraZmm5%2BkuG65xJqj</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lazarus-muoka.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About Lazarus Muoka On Naija News</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./albert-johnston-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Albert Sidney Johnston - Trivia, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
