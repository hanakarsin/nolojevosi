But when Greg Daniels, who developed the U.S. version of The Office, was tasked with working on the Netflix comedy <a href=#><u>Space Force</u></a>, it was a challenge he accepted. Of course, it helped that Steve Carell had agreed to be at the show’s helm along the way and the rest of the cast is full of comedic stars from inside and outside of Greg’s orbit, no pun intended.</p><p>The show is about a new branch of the government dedicated to getting a team of people on the moon and because it takes place in the present day in a world not unlike our own, viewers might wonder if the Space Force is real in real life. It almost sounds like a made up name for the branch, as depicted in the series trailer, but the show was inspired by a plight of the real-life president.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, is the 'Space Force' a real thing?</h2><p>In 2019, the U.S. Space Force was created as another branch of the government dedicated to space exploration. In order to be part of the real-life Space Force, you must first be a member of one of the branches of the military and get approval to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>volunteer for the Space Force</u></a>. It’s a bit different from the one on the Netflix show, wherein it appears that the crew is intent on choosing non-military personnel to take part in the program.</p><p>"You have to get approval of your service and the approval of the Space Force, but those options are open to you," Chief of Space Operations General Jay Raymond said during an April 2020 virtual town hall meeting. "What we can’t do is break the Army, or break the Navy, or break the Marines while we stand up the Space Force, but if you’re interested, we’d love to have you."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>wow leaders of the military sure are more congenial than we imagined <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/69OUuESsFO</a></p>— Space Force (@realspaceforce) <a href=#>May 24, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">It was inspired by the real U.S. Space Force.</h2><p>Even if the fictional Space Force in the show is different from the real thing, it was still inspired by it. Greg Daniels told Collider that in drumming up <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ideas for the show</u></a>, he had watched the televised announcement about the real Space Force and thought about the pressure the general would be under in real life. The goal was to retell the story, but with a character viewers could relate to.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Will there be a 'Space Force' Season 2?</h2><p>Greg also told Collider that there are plans for future seasons. He expects the characters to help drive the comedy forward. So even if you will have to wait for an unspecified amount of time after watching all of Season 1 of Space Force in one sitting, there is a chance Season 2 will be here eventually.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nowhere to go but up. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/EhP8CLN9S9</a></p>— Space Force (@realspaceforce) <a href=#>May 12, 2020</a></figure><p>"It is a character comedy, and so we are trying to make it work for the long term," he told the outlet.</p><p>Netflix hasn't yet announced an official renewal, but if fans flock to their streaming devices of choice and respond well to the first season, it could be renewed sooner rather than later.</p><p>Space Force premieres on Netflix on May 29.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuv8%2Bamp5llqS%2FpLGMq5yapA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./319679-why-paw-paw-and-i-separated-aki-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Paw Paw And I Separated - Aki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./governors-enforcing-covid-19-vaccination-want-to-make-us-laugh-adeboye-sends-message-to-rccg.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Governors Enforcing COVID-19 Vaccination Want To Make Us Laugh</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
