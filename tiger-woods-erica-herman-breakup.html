Erica attended many of Tiger's golf competitions but has not been spotted with him since they attended the U.S. Open tennis tournament in August 2022.

She also claims the trust made "scurrilous and defamatory allegations how she obtained the money." In the lawsuit, Erica claimed to have an "oral tenancy agreement" to remain in their home for five additional years after residing in the home for six.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Masters Champions Dinner quarantine style.
