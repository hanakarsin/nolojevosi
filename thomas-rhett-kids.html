"I do feel like getting to play with my friends in the neighborhood or going fishing with my dad or going hiking with my friends, you’re forced to be creative. You’re forced to let your imagination run."</p><p>As a father of three (soon-to-be four), the "Country Again" singer explained that it's easy to just sometimes give your kids an iPad to keep them entertained.&nbsp;</p><p>But he doesn't want to regret his parenting decisions later in life. "I don’t want to look back in 25 years and be like, ‘That was the dad that I was,'" he said.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by ThomasRhettAkins (@thomasrhettakins)</a></p></figure><p>Thomas explained that he and his wife have made it their mission to teach their daughters about the outdoors. The family has taken several road trips across the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>He said, "Hopefully, one day when they get older with their own families they’ll be like, ‘I remember when my dad took me to the Grand Canyon or took me down the street to go fishing.’ Things that we can teach them that we loved about our childhood that hopefully, they can teach to their kids as well."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Thomas Rhett reveals that his latest album was written from the "guilt" of missing moments with family.</h2><p>In 2021, Thomas released "Country Again: Side A," which delved deeper into the singer's southern roots. In his hit single "Country Again," Thomas sings about trading sunsets with his wife for moments on his phone and not being present in the moment. &nbsp;</p><p>"That’s a lot of where this whole record was written from, just a lot of that guilt and being like, ‘Man, I've been missing out on so much because I’ve been so distracted by social media or just technology in general,'" he said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>He continued, "I don’t want my kids to make that same mistake growing up. The more quality time we can spend with our kids, especially in the outdoors, I just think the better the memory and the better the bond you’re going to create with your family." He added, "2020 made me realize that I had been doing too much of the screen time and I forgot how much I love to be in the outdoors."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWwucCsZKuglanBbrfInao%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tinubu-shettima-arrive-apc-national-secretariat-in-abuja.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tinubu, Shettima Arrive APC National Secretariat In Abuja</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lizzy-musi-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lizzy Musi - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
