I met him through my manager. He told we were going to see a producer, I didn’t know where we were going so we ended up in Don Jazzy’s house. I didn’t even know where I was. I ended up meeting Baby Fresh, Altims and a few others. They started listening to songs that I had done before and I had this nervousness in me. Not long after, I saw a shadow behind me and when I turned around to see who it was at the door, it was Don Jazzy and I almost fainted, I just told myself to stay composed. It even got worse when Don Jazzy started listening to my songs, I just got so nervous. He told us he would get back to us and the next day he pulled a call through and that was it.</i>”</p><p>[article_adwert]</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt39e22qf0a97g.jpeg><p>On when she finally signed on to Mavin Records, Di’ja said: “<i>We started recording and we recorded quite a few tracks. At that time nobody was bothered about a contract or papers, we just wanted to work. From there I met Reekado and then Korede Bello. We didn’t even know there was a plan; we were just happy working and enjoying each other’s company. We recorded for about 8 to 9 months at that time before Don Jazzy even considered giving us a contract.</i>”</p><p>Speaking on how she chooses her kind of music, Di’ja disclosed that she enjoys been herself anytime she is about writing her song and it can take her up to five years to finish song.</p><p>She said: “<i>I didn’t, like I said I just became myself. I can write a song for 5 years. I still have songs that I haven’t finished writing since 2008. This is because there’s just this thing about been yourself. Write your songs as they come from your heart. I like been crazy and I experiment my craziness while recording.”</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>See How Di'ja Staged An Amazing Performance In Kaduna</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt77vrrq81bml.jpeg><p><i>“Sometimes I would be like Altims or BabyFresh please commot that thing and they would be like they love it and I should do it again. Sometimes I would beg them to take it off and when Don Jazzy walks in I would be like a little disturbed and he would encourage me to be crazy, be free and be myself, he would say be stupid, it is actually trying to be stupid you find your smartest moment. Because it is during that moment of been stupid you would realize something that would pay off. I think Music comes with a form of madness. You just have to be free, crazy, stupid and yourself. Don’t try to please everyone, please yourself even if it takes you to be crazy</i>.”</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3iFj2luZp6Rory2v4ymmK%2BhnmLAta3RZqapnZ6oerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIydpqdlmpbHu8WNoaumpA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./i-have-a-man-already-bbnaijas-maria-chike.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'I Have A Man Already'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./afcon-2021-maduka-okoye-reacts-as-nigerians-drag-him-on-instagram.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Maduka Okoye Reacts As Nigerians Drag Him On Instagram</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
