The kind of man that admits this on national television has absolutely no shame and it's a beautiful thing.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. 27-year-old welder, Sam Bledsoe</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: cbs</span></figure><p>Sam used to wrangle wild animals like snakes and raccoons with her bare hands, and raised honeybees. She also believes that her experience as a waitress, bartender, and hairdresser will make her a master of intelligence to win the competition.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. 23-year-old lifeguard, Tyler Crispen</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: cbs</span></figure><p>This dude's a champion bowler and really, really, really likes quinoa as well as pre-workout supplements. He's also very, very, very tan. Hence the name "Crispen."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. 25-year-old flight attendant, Bayleigh Denton</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: cbs</span></figure><p>Bayleigh's super into yoga, the Bible, but also mentions that she blows up on people by calling them out on their stuff. Just the kind of dichotomous personality traits that'll result in priceless household drama.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. 28-year-old professional dancer, Jason Monduix</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: cbs</span></figure><p>He admittedly gets very sensitive when people make fun of his height — Jason's 4'8". He also has a thing for melatonin and hoverboards, which don't sound like a safe mix.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. 21-year-old college student, Haleigh Broucher</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: cbs</span></figure><p>Haleigh's terrified of chainsaws and crossing the street. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">So maybe watching this scene </a>while walking around NYC would be a bad idea for her.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. 40-year-old former undercover cop, Steve Arienta</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: cbs</span></figure><p>This guy stresses his need for a nightly bath. Might have something to do with the fact he was a boss wrestler in high school as well as an amazing football player - he won a scholarship to Northwestern to play pigskin. Then used all of that to get a pretty good Organized Crime Investigation Division gig with the NYPD.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. 30-year-old pro football player, Kaycee Clark</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: cbs</span></figure><p>Kaycee's the first pro football player to ever be on the show, and as it turns out, Big Brother the only TV show she watches. I mean, not even Breaking Bad?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. 28-year-old medical sales rep, Winston Hines</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: cbs</span></figure><p>This dude from Bowling Green, Kentucky wants people to know he gets mistaken for Ryan Reynolds and Ryan Gosling all the time. And he's held his high school's 40-yard-dash record for over 10 years.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10. 29-year-old Vegas entertainer, Rachel Swindler</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: cbs</span></figure><p>Yes, it's funny that someone who works in Vegas has the last name Swindler, but "Craychel" (nickname her friends gave her, ha) also knows how to user her power over men to secure big tips—and that kind of manipulation could be good for the competition.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11. 26-year-old shipping manager, Scottie Salton</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: cbs</span></figure><p>Scottie's awesome because he chose to share his family's unique child punishment structure by mentioning how he was the one who got grounded after being vomited on by his brother. He also revealed he's a 26-year-old virgin who's never been kissed.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12. 34-year-old stay-at-home-mom, Angie Lantry</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: cbs</span></figure><p>Lantry definitely has a Mrs. Frizzle vibe going on, and it looks like she leans towards &nbsp;hippiedom. She's had natural births for all of her children, is all about the "powers" of crystals and burning sage to remove "bad juju," and a unicorn apparently walked her down the aisle on her wedding day.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">13. 23-year-old day trader, Chris Williams</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: cbs</span></figure><p>Williams has a photographic memory, hates the beach, and is all about self-help, self empowerment and money moves. Sounds like tons of fun at parties.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">14. 26-year-old fitness model, Angela Rummans</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: cbs</span></figure><p>Rummans is a self-touted freak athlete who's looking forward to emasculating the house dudes at sports, which will hopefully make for some excellent TV.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">15. 25-year-old cyber security engineer, Brett Robinson</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: cbs</span></figure><p>Robinson has a fear of the ladies thinking he has bad breath so toothbrushes are a top priority for him. He also likes hacking into his friends' computers for fun.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">16. 24-year-old life coach, Kaitlyn Herman</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: cbs</span></figure><p>Herman's also a big time crystal lover, and sleeps with her eyes open. A psychic medium revealed to her that she's going to be one of the most influential self-helpers in the world, and she randomly sages family members to remove bad vibes.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">17.</h2><p>Here's to Season 20's cast and the many who will probably come after.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcWZpbl9nhXB9tbGEcoRfl7aoecGrpq2glad6tLHArKanZWJlenM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tinder-math-personality-test.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Guy's Tinder Profile Is a &amp;quot;Douchey&amp;quot; Math Quiz That Tests a Woman's Personality</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./economic-recovery-world-bank-to-give-170bn-to-nigeria-others.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>World Bank To Give $170bn To Nigeria, Others</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
