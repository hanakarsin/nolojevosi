Inspector Atule pulled his gun and shot his colleague. He threatened to shoot more policemen and resisted efforts to disarm him by other policemen in the team.</p><p>“The Inspector died before he could get medical attention. The killer policeman also escaped arrest, but we heard he later handed himself over to the police.”</p><p>Police Public Relations Officer, Abia State Command, SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, who confirmed the incident, said an investigation has commenced as the killer police is being detained.</p><p>He said, “It’s quite unfortunate and discreditable. The policemen are from SPU Base 15 Anambra State but are attached to Ginger Onwusibe. The erring policeman is in custody while the deceased is in the morgue.
