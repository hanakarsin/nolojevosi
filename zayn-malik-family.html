But the guys of the former boy band are now all grown up and <a href=#><u>Zayn Malik</u></a> just became a dad. Yeah, it‚Äôs a lot to handle during a year when there was already way too much going on to take anything else in.</p><p>Because Zayn and girlfriend Gigi Hadid became parents together in 2020, you might be wondering about Zayn‚Äôs other family members. Even though he has moved past his days of One Direction crooning, Zayn is still a superstar singer and, as a result, some of his family members have seen a little piece of that celebrity pie.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Zayn Malik's family has been in the spotlight for a while because of his fame.</h2><p>Zayn isn't from a family of musicians or celebrities, but he has remained close to his parents and sisters over the years. He actually has three sisters, one of whom dealt with internet backlash when she announced that, at the age of 17, she was getting married. Safaa Malik was just 17 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>when she got married</u></a> and, not long after, had a baby with her 18-year-old boyfriend.</p><p>And because some of her social media followers deemed her too young to be taking such bold adult steps, she dealt with several internet trolls. Zayn‚Äôs sister Doniya Malik has a less colorful history with the internet, but she has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an Instagram</u></a> account with more than 600,000 followers because she‚Äôs an established makeup artist. And, probably, because she‚Äôs also Zayn‚Äôs big sis.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>baby daddy ‚ò∫Ô∏è</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Gigi Hadid</a> (@gigihadid) on Jul 31, 2020 at 6:23pm PDT</p><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Zayn‚Äôs other sister, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Waliyha Azad Malik</u></a>, also has hundreds of thousands of Instagram followers.

It‚Äôs unclear what Waliyha does for a living, but she also appears to be living her best Instagram influencer life at the moment.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik welcomed their new baby girl in 2020.</h2><p>On Sept. 24, 2020, Zayn announced to the world via social media that his longtime girlfriend Gigi had given birth to their baby girl. They had announced the pregnancy back in April 2020 to excitement from their family and fans alike. Although he didn't reveal their baby‚Äôs name at the time of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>birth announcement</u></a>, Zayn did write a lengthy caption under a photo of her tiny hand gripping his finger.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>#TB Happy Mothers Day @trishamalik1069 üíï Thank you for everything you do for us love you üíï</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Doniya Malik</a> (@doniyabeauty) on Mar 31, 2019 at 6:21am PDT</p></figure><p>"Our baby girl is here, healthy and beautiful," he wrote. "To try [to] put into words how I am feeling right now would be an impossible task. The love I feel for this tiny human is beyond my understanding. Grateful to know her, proud to call her mine, and thankful for the life we will have together."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Zayn Malik changed his name ‚Äî sort of.</h2><p>You probably know Zayn for his first and last name and that‚Äôs all well and good. But, once he branched off from One Direction, he had the idea to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>drop his last name</u></a> altogether. Which, to be honest, isn't all that uncommon, especially for someone with an already unique first name. In 2016, Zayn announced his plan to go by his first name only, like Adele or Beyonc√©.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Zayn Malik (@zayn)</a> on Feb 1, 2019 at 7:08pm PST</p></figure><p>"It just fits me more," he explained. "I don't know anybody who goes by the first name and their surname with friends and family. I wanted it to be more personal I guess in that sense."</p><p>Now, to some, he is known as simply Zayn. To his and Gigi‚Äôs baby, however, he‚Äôll be known as "Daddy."
