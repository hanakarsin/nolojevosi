The singer and guitarist has achieved mainstream success thanks to his infectious hit track "Bad Habits," which recently shot to the number one position on Billboard. Steve is far from new to making music, but his recent success has seen him reaching millions of new listeners every day, meaning more and more people are curious about who exactly he is.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>With that being said, has Steve ever shared anything about his dating life?

The closest and most recent glimpse into that aspect of his life came on Mar. 3, 2022, when Steve posted a since-deleted snapshot on Instagram of him snuggled up to an unidentified man. Steve was sitting in his lap, but the other individual was not tagged or named.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Steve Lacy's sexuality?</h2><p>What we do know is that Steve has suggested in the past that he has a fluid sexuality. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Attitude</a>, when an anonymous user asked Steve during a Tumblr chat whether he was bisexual or straight, he simply stated "I’m human."</p><p>Pressed even further by fans to reveal if he’d ever date a guy, he went on to say, "Sure, why not?"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Then, another anonymous user took things to another level, asking Steve why he has a "blatantly anti-black preference in partners." To this question, the singer had quite a bit to say.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"The reason for it all isn’t anti black … at all. growing up around black males, they were always my competitors," he led off by telling fans. "I never viewed or saw myself doing anything sexual with my neighbors ... I literally, like I said, see them as brothers. As much as you or whoever thinks this sounds like bulls--t, it’s from a real place."</p><p>Steve concluded his point by noting, "I’m a [n-word] from Compton; I don’t dislike black people, I prefer to live here and be around POC because I love black people, I’m just not attracted to black boys. That is it. I still love them and want them to do well in life, we just won’t date. Sorry."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How old is Steve Lacy?</h2><p>As of the time of writing, Steve is 24 years old.
