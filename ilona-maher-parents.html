While attending Saint Michael's College, Mike was also a rugby player, playing 15s while his daughter plays sevens. The change happened after years of being a top athlete in the other sports she competing in, and she was itching to try something else.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ilona Maher (@ilonamaher)</a></p></figure><p>“By spring of my senior year [of high school], I [felt] done with softball," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>.
