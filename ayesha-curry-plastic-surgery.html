We looked into it!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Ayesha Curry wears many hats. She's an actress, a celebrity cook, a cookbook author, the wife of NBA star <a href=#>Stephen Curry</a>, a mom of three. Oh, and she looks fantastic while doing it all, for the record.</p><p>Plenty of fans and social media followers have likely wondered through the years: Has Ayesha had plastic surgery?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ayesha posted bathing suit photo</h2><p>On May 23, Ayesha posted a fire Instagram photo of herself <a href=#>in a bathing suit</a>. Her caption read, "Took me long enough." But while most of her fans are congratulating her on clearly getting her fitness on, some wonder if she <a href=#>got plastic surgery</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's another photo that's a bit more up close. Although Ayesha's face looks a little airbrushed, you can still see she didn't bother editing out her stretch marks, which is awesome.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Ayesha Curry get plastic surgery?</h2><p>Ayesha has only ever confirmed getting plastic surgery once, and it was in 2015 when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she got breast implants</a>. In May 2019, Ayesha admitted that she decided to get a "lift" after suffering from postpartum depression after giving birth to her second child, Ryan.</p><p>"I didn't realize at the time, but after having Ryan, I was battling a bit of postpartum that lingered for a while. It came in the form of me being depressed about my body. So I made a rash decision," she told Working Mother magazine.</p><p>She continued, "The intention was just to have them lifted, but I came out with these bigger boobs I didn't want. I got the most botched boob job on the face of the planet. They're worse now than they were before. I would never do anything like that again, but I'm an advocate of it if something makes you happy, who cares about the judgement?"&nbsp;</p><p>Although we don't know for sure (and it's none of our business), Ayesha probably just looks amazing on her own. Here are a few more photos of Ayesha during quarantine that show her looking just as fab.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Furthermore, Ayesha has been very open about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her weight loss journey</a> after having her third child, Canon.</p><p>"I'm not in the entertainment industry, in the traditional sense. I'm not thin; I'm 170 pounds on a good day. It's been a journey for me, and that's why I want my girls to understand who they are â€”&nbsp;and to love it."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Some are criticizing Ayesha for her "hypocritical" statements about publicly wearing bathing suits.</h2><p>While some are wondering about plastic surgery, others are annoyed that Ayesha is apparently a "hypocrite" for going back on her 2015 tweet that says, "Everyone's into barely wearing clothes these days huh? Not my style. I like to keep the good stuff covered up for the one who matters." &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Everyone's into barely wearing clothes these days huh? Not my style. I like to keep the good stuff covered up for the one who matters ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚</p>â€” Ayesha Curry (@ayeshacurry) <a href=#>December 6, 2015</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>While obviously it's not okay to police other women for their choice in clothing, it could just be possible that Ayesha's ideology around what women "should" wear has changed. We all grow up, become more mature, and learn from our mistakes. So maybe let's be a little easier on Ayesha, shall we? She's clearly feeling confident and awesome, and the praise she's also getting is well-deserved.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflsamv8eaZJytoqfGbrzLmqqtoZNiwLa%2Bxp6psg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./i-would-have-put-the-money-to-better-use-not-give-erica-kiddwaya-speaks-on-if-he-had-won.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I Would Have Put The Money To Better Use, Not Give Erica</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./261633-yet-popular-ntv-presenter-opens-struggle-endometriosis-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Yet another popular NTV presenter opens up about her struggle with endometriosis</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
