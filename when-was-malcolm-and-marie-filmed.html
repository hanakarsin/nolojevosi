Malcolm Elliott (<a href=#>John David Washington</a>), the filmmaker, is anxiously awaiting good reviews, especially one from a critic who has been harsh on him in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>As he deals with the stress, he begins to argue and test his relationship with girlfriend Marie Jones (<a href=#>Zendaya</a>). The movie takes place in real time, as the two figure out whether or not they should even be together.</p><p>Because Malcolm & Marie was one of the first productions to pick up during the pandemic, viewers might be wondering when exactly it was filmed.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When was 'Malcolm & Marie' filmed?</h2><p>The black-and-white drama was written, produced, and filmed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was the first feature to do so. Sam Levinson directed and wrote Malcolm & Marie, and he first worked with star Zendaya on the HBO series, Euphoria. &nbsp;</p><p>While production on Euphoria was shut down due to the pandemic in March of 2020, Sam and Zendaya toyed around with the idea of creating a film in the interim. Sam had the idea for the film six days later.</p><p>They settled on a real-time relationship drama that would entirely take place at one location (in this case, a private residence).</p><p>Filming began on June 17, 2020, and ended just two weeks later on July 2.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure that the cast and crew wouldn't further risk exposure to the deadly virus, one location was used. Marie and Malcolm's home in the film was the Caterpillar House, which is a ranch house located in Carmel-By-the-Sea in Northern California.&nbsp;</p><p>The private residence sits on 30 acres of land, making it the perfect, isolated location to shoot a film during a pandemic.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'Malcolm & Marie' followed all COVID-19 protocols.</h2><p>In addition to the one filming location for the entire shoot, Malcolm & Marie followed other guidelines in order to shoot amid the ongoing pandemic. Production was approved by the Writers Guild of America, the Directors Guild of America, and SAG-AFTRA after all protocols were in place.&nbsp;</p><p>The cast and crew all quarantined ahead of time, and they stayed in isolation after production ended. There were also extra efforts made for regular sanitation, and only 12 people were allowed to be on set at any one time.&nbsp;</p><p>Pre-wrapped food was delivered to those on set, and temperature checks were done throughout each shooting day.</p><p>Because of this, many of the crew members were responsible for multiple tasks on set.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Both Zendaya and John David pulled their own costumes and did their own makeup to limit the amount of people on location. They completed rehearsals in parking lots.</p><p>Plus, the only two characters that viewers see on-screen are Marie and Malcolm.&nbsp;</p><p>Malcolm & Marie is available to stream on Netflix now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmuoywmKxlnZa5pLvLpmSappRiuqK%2ByJ5kn6GcorKl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-presidency-group-vows-to-buy-nomination-for-yahaya-bello.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Group Vows To Buy Nomination For Yahaya Bello</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bachelor-victoria-f-affairs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Victoria Fuller Is Confronted About Rumors That She's a Homewrecker During Her Hometown Date 'Ba</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
