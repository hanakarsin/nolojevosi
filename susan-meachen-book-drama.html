However, it seems that some authors have gone to extreme lengths to promote their books. Enter: author <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">Susan Meachen</a>, who has recently resurfaced online after reports of her death by suicide in 2020.</p><p>In new posts on Facebook and Twitter, Susan Meachen has been accused of creating a death hoax in order to sell her books.

She was reportedly working on her last book, Love to Last a Lifetime, to finish by her daughter's wedding. In her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">author bio</a>, Susan dubs herself "Author of Perfectly Flawed Romances" thanks to her not-so-happy book endings.</p><p>In October 2020, a woman claiming to be Susan's daughter logged into her author's Facebook page and announced her mother's death in a since-deleted post. Susan's daughter wrote, "Sorry thought everyone on this page knew my mom had passed away. Dead people don't post on social media. I've been on this account for a week now finishing her last book, my wedding gift from her."</p><p>The statement continued, "If you'd like to talk to some of the people who have been helping me let me know. We've asked for very little from everyone but I'm asking that you leave Connie Ortiz alone, she has been a saint through this all she deserves some peace. Again please be respectful. Now here's the link to her last book and goodbye!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Author Susan Meachen died from suicide 2 years ago. Except it turns out she didnâ€™t.

The proceeds from the book also allegedly went to Susan's family, although this is currently unconfirmed.</p><p>On Jan. 3, 2023, Susan Meachen posted in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Ward Facebook group</a>, a group for independent authors of which Susan is an administrator, seemingly announcing her rise from the grave. She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">began</a>, "I debated on how to do this a million times and still not sure if it's right or not. There's going to be tons of questions and a lot of people leaving the group I'd guess."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Facebook/SamanthaAColeAuthor</span></figure><p>"But my family did what they thought was best for me and I can't fault them for it. I almost died again at my own hand and they had to go through all that hell again. Returning to The Ward doesn't mean much but I am in a good place now and I am hoping to write again. Let the fun begin," Susan concluded.</p><p>Author Samantha A. Cole wrote <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a Facebook post</a> about Susan's supposed death and subsequent return, detailing her betrayal and realization that a user named "TN Steele," who volunteered to assume the role of administrator of The Ward upon Susan's alleged death, was actually a false identity. Samantha alleges that the real identity of "TN Steele" is none other than undead author Susan Meachen.</p><p>Angry users who donated to Susan's family are now <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">asking for their money back</a>, according to Twitter user @anoldcurse. Currently, Susan has not responded to criticism for faking her own death, nor to allegations that her family kept funds raised in her memory for fictional funeral expenses.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMK0rc1mpJ6Zk52yr3nBqKakZZSnrq6t</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jerry-tarkanian-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jerry Tarkanian - Trivia, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zamfara-first-class-emir-kidnapped-by-unknown-gunmen.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Zamfara First Class Emir Kidnapped By Unknown Gunmen</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
