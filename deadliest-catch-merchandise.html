Here's Where You Can Get Some</h1><p class="sc-fkmfhw hDHRag">No need to fish around anymore.</p>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jYKDjX hHZJHw">Callie (Carlos) Cadorniga</a><p class="sc-bxLYvs cnDLfX">Published July 9 2024, 2:46 p.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Time Bandit</a></figure><p>It's easy enough for most people to walk into stores like Hot Topic or even a comic book store to pick up shirts and other related clothing that has your favorite superhero, anime, cartoon, or video game on it. But then again, you're not most people. You're looking for merchandise for <a href=#>Deadliest Catch</a>. The popular reality show on the Discovery Channel has been ongoing for nearly 20 years by now as it continues to chronicle the adventures of real-life crab fishermen during dangerous crabbing seasons.</p><p>The show has earned more than 100 nominations for TV awards throughout its run and has even given rise to a few spin-offs. With plenty of Deadliest Catch to check out, it stands to reason that fans would want to nab at least a couple of items and clothing that would show everyone how much they enjoy the show. Luckily for those folks, there are a few official outlets for Deadliest Catch merchandise that you can check out to show your love for the crews. Here's what's officially available.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Fans of Captain Wild Bill has an entire line of products.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Captain Wild Bill</a></figure><p>Captain "Wild" Bill Wichrowski of the F/V Summer Bay sells plenty of branded products with his logo and iconography on them. His official site has everything from hats, thermoses, can sleeves, shirts, hoodies, and even camo gear that'd be perfect for all the <a href=#>Wild Bill</a> cosplayers out there.</p><p>Check out the site <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Rep the Bad Boys of the Being Sea with Time Bandit merch.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Our best-selling Captains Hat is back in stock! <a href=#>https://t.co/Cs2ucGxYo1</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/L6T0VSKhdl</a></p>— F/V Time Bandit (@FVTimeBandit) <a href=#>December 28, 2019</a></figure><p>If you're a fan of the crew aboard the F/V Time Bandit run by Johnathan Hillstrand, then the Time Bandit store is for you. Shop everything from shirts, hats, mugs, and even children's storybooks that feature writing and illustrations from John himself.</p><p>Click <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for Time Bandit swag.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Captain Jake Anderson had his own shop, but it appears to be shut down.</h2><p>Fans of the F/V Saga may be disappointed to know that the site for its merch is no longer actively selling its products. While the shop itself is still up — displaying the many shirts, hoodies, and phone cases with the Saga logo on them — all of the product listings now lead to broken RedBubble links.</p><p>This no doubt can be attributed to the fallout of Captain <a href=#>Jake Anderson</a> losing his vessel. Season 20 reveals much of the financial trouble that Jake has fallen into after undisclosed legal troubles caused him to lose the Saga.</p><p>This list, while short, avoids many of the generic user-generate t-shirt sites through which anyone can simply paste a logo onto a shirt and call it a day. These sites come directly from the captains and crew on the show who have plenty of clothes, swag, and merchandise with their iconography on it for superfans to pick up and show off their love of the show.</p><p>As of this writing, Season 20 of Deadliest Catch is currently airing. Check it out every Tuesday on the Discovery Channel and <a href=#>Discovery Plus</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbKisMuinKysXZiuta%2FHZqSeqpOdrq%2BwyKyc</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-plays-erin-voss-locke-and-key.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Plays Erin Voss on 'Locke &amp;amp; Key' Season 2?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./67807-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tonto Dikeh &amp;amp; D'banj Turn A Year Older Today</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
