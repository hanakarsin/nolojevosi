Tom Brady Officially Announces His Retirement in Emotional Video</h1>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jYKDjX hHZJHw">Gabrielle Bernardini</a><p class="sc-bxLYvs cnDLfX">Updated Feb. 1 2023, 11:56 a.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Future Hall of Fame quarterback <a href=#>Tom Brady</a> is inarguably the G.O.A.T. (Greatest of All Time) in the sport of football.</p><p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneer firmly cemented his legacy (yet again) during Super Bowl LV, in which the team beat the favored <a href=#>Patrick Mahomes and Kansas City Chiefs</a> 31 to 9. As always, never bet against TB12.</p><p>But, aside from his impressive Super Bowl ring collection (he now boasts seven), sports fans and athletes are amazed by Tom's mastery of the game at his age. Since professional football is a contact sport that requires players to be at the top of their game, many <a href=#>NFL</a> athletes typically retire in their 30s. However, No. 12 is the exception to this rule and has played at a top level throughout the first half of his forties.</p><p>So, when is Tom retiring? After retiring in 2022 — and then unretiring for the season — Tom has now officially hung up his jersey in 2023. Keep reading to find out what he had to say.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Yes, Tom Brady is officially retiring.</h2><p>A call back to last year — when he retired on Feb. 1, 2022, via a lengthy Instagram message, and then unretired just weeks later — Tom took to the social media platform in January 2023 to officially retire "for good."</p><p>"Good morning, guys. I’ll get to the point right away. I’m retiring for good," he said in an emotional Instagram video. "I know the process was a pretty big deal last time. So, when I woke up this morning, I figured I’d just press record and let you guys know first. So, I won’t be long-winded. You only get one super emotional retirement essay and I used mine up last year."</p><p>Tom thanked his family, teammates, and friends for his lengthy career, stating that he feels "grateful."</p><p>Though many are shocked by the sudden announcement of his retirement from the NFL, Tom seems to be content with his decision.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tom Brady (@tombrady)</a></p></figure><p>For years, people have pressed the former Patriots quarterback to give an exact date that he will hang up his helmet for good.
