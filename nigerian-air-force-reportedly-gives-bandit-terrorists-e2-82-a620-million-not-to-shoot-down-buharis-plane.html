The ransom, nearly $50,000 in crisp Nigerian bank notes, wasn’t for a person, but to retrieve a weapon that directly threatened the country’s president,” the report read.</p><p>The rugged, lawless jungle that covers parts of Kaduna, Zamfara and the president’s home state of Katsina has served as a vast haven for bandits terrorising Nigeria’s northwestern communities.</p><p>“The mission to buy back the antiaircraft gun began with a handoff from a high-ranking air force intelligence officer in the capital Abuja: a black zip-up bag he said was full of 20 million Nigerian naira,” WSJ reported, stating that such weapon in the hands of bandits posted a threat to President Buhari, “who had been planning to fly to his hometown about 80 miles away.”</p><p>It was gathered that the deal was successful and the Gun truck with 12.7 caliber anti-aircraft fire was reportedly disassembled and transported back to the military on motorbikes.</p><p>WSJ did not specify when the deal was brokered or the presidential trip that was planned.</p><p>Reports had emerged this week that President Buhari was planning on traveling to Daura, Katsina, his hometown.</p><p>According to reports, the president was going to observe some rest after gruelling schedule and trips overseers.</p><p>“He’s departing for Daura this weekend for home rest. He just wants to go and rest. He will return next week,” a presidential source was quoted as saying on Wednesday, October 13.</p><p>But, the presidency had <a href=# rel=noopener>cancelled the trip citing security reasons.</a></p><p>“The earlier trip to Daura has been stepped down over threats of the resurgence of #EndSARS memorial uprising,” SaharaReporters quoted the source saying.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5BwZqehl5q%2Fqq3NZpiiql2bvLOvxGapnqifp8GmsMuyZKChpprAbq7Ap5uirF2psrO%2BzqugrKyjYnKGfoRxaV55Zmd9brnIpaOip55iu7DAjK2mZquYpLy1ecOorqdlkqq1or7IrGSppJGjsnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-do-hollywood-writers-make.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>You'd Be Surprised at How Much Hollywood Writers Actually Make</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kimberly-irene-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kimberly Irene - Edad, Familia, Biografa</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
