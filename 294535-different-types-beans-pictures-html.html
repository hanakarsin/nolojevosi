They were popularized because, in addition to being a source of proteins, which were scarce in most African diets, they also contain carbohydrates. This means that the missionaries were killing two birds with one stone, helping African communities cook meals that were calorie dense to combat malnutrition and at the same time, provide the needed amino acids to the body. Currently, there are tens, maybe hundreds of grain species in the local market.
