They were met by armed locals who had&nbsp;knowledge of the impending attack and had dug out trenches to obstruct the terrorists' movements.</p><p>Residents say they have formed a vigilante group, the so-called Civilian JTF, since the military are not doing enough to protect ordinary Nigerians. A trader from&nbsp;Kalabalge said this is why most attacks by Boko Haram on their village have been repelled.</p><p>As soon as they gathered the information of the future attack, local men positioned themselves in surrounding bushes and forests, armed with bows and arrows, dane guns and pump action rifles.</p><p>An anonymous eyewitness, who spoke to the BBC Hausa Service, said the area was "littered with bodies" after the fighting, adding he counted 50 bodies of the insurgents in one village, 150 in another. According to Dr. Peregrino Brimah, coordinator of the Every Nigerian Do Something project, about 20 vigilantes also lost their lives fighting, while some sustained injuries.</p><p>Speaking to the AFP on condition of anonymity, a Borno official disclosed that at least 10 insurgents have been detained, scores killed and injured. According to Dr. Brimah, the number of captured insurgents is 35. A number of motorcycles were recovered from the insurgents, as well as several Toyota Hilux vehicles and an armoured personnel carrier.</p><p>Also, according to SaharaReporters, state Governor Kashim Shettima is to visit Kalabalge later this week.</p><p>Kala-Balge LGA lies along the shores of the Lake Chad, sharing border with Cameroon.</p><p>Despite the emergency rule imposed on the state a year ago, Borno State has been a <a href=#>constant target</a> for Boko Haram attacks. Over 200 female students were kidnapped by the sect on April 14 from Chibok town. Ngala LGA of the state has also been hit, as over 300 persons were killed on May 5; another 30 lost their lives on May 8, when a bridge linking Nigeria to Cameroon was bombed by the sect.</p><p>The Borno State chapter of Civilian JTF has applied to Nigerian government for the right to bear arms to protect and defend themselves. The government is yet to officially respond to the multiple requests.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3d%2BlHJloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1122565-gotv-subscription-plans-channels-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>GOtv Nigeria guide: packages, channels list, prices, contacts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kwankwaso-not-stepping-down-for-tinubu-he-has-inherited-buharis-12-million-northern-votes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Kwankwaso Not Stepping Down For Tinubu, He Has Inherited Buharis 12 Million Northern Votes'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
