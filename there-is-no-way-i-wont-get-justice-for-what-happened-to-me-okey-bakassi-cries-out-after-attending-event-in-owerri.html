While doing my job, it was time for the celebrant to cut the cake. After cutting the cake, I invited people to snap pictures.</p><p>“They were coming in batches and as we took photographs, we made way for other people to take pictures.</p><p>“Some sets of young men came to take pictures, finished taking pictures and engaged the celebrant and they were discussing. I simply called their attention to step aside so that other people can continue the flow of photo section, that was the only interaction I had with them.</p><p>“The set of things that followed, first was a threat, ‘do you want something to happen to you in this Owerri?’ It was uncalled for. As an Mc, my role is to just make sure the event was running smoothly.</p><p>“When I saw his reaction, I knew he was calling for a fight, I stepped aside.</p><p>“It looked like these young men were boiling for a fight. They shoved me on their way out. I didn’t alter a word. My professional training, I was not trained to go into altercations with somebody at an event like that.</p><p>“I was busy attending to another guest, when one of them attacked me from behind. It took other guests, restraining them and taking them out of the event.</p><p>“I know we live in dangerous times but I will get justice, I will find them. Thank God for the quick response of the Imo State director of DSS and men of the DSS who came to escort me back to my hotel after the event.</p><p>“Nobody knows what plans they had and what would have happened but I will let the police do their job, there’s no way I won’t get justice. I look for nobody trouble but for somebody to assault me just in the cause of doing my job, I will definitely get justice.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5FsZq2glaeybrXSZqWoZaeWxm61jLCmp6xdnLK1ecmuqq2hk5p6p7vRZq6hmaRitaK8z56lnpxdqbxuucRmpqSdqWKvorfArKqiZZOntqa%2FjKisrWWRm8Gmvoyaq62dnpm2r7OMnq2epqRitq95zrCcq6qZZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./epl-chelsea-close-to-agreeing-deals-with-two-key-defenders.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chelsea Close To Agreeing Deals With Two Key Defenders</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./367673-polisi-avamiwa-na-wakazi-akitekeleza-agizo-la-kuvaa-maski-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Polisi avamiwa na wakazi akitekeleza agizo la kuvaa maski</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
