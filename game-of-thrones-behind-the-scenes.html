It also contains adorable behind-the-scenes photos of the cast and crew being cute between takes, and you might not be able to help yourself from squealing in delight when you see them. You have officially been warned.</p><p>We are coming to the end of Game of Thrones, the show that has carried us (and to be honest, HBO) through nearly the last decade. After Sunday, there will be no more new Game of Thrones episodes ever...or at least not for like two years until they decide to "reboot" it. I know, I know. It's hard to hear, and it's even harder to comprehend. And if it's so difficult for us as fans, imagine what it's like for the cast and crew to let go of a life-changing, career-making job like this one.</p><p>Luckily, many members of the beloved Game of Thrones cast have Instagram. And post to that Instagram. From set. So while we might be saying goodbye to Game of Thrones, we never have to say goodbye to these cutie patootie behind-the-scenes posts from the citizens of Westeros.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. Ser Jorah and his queen</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Emilia Clarke posted this perfect photo after Ser Jorah died protecting Daenerys at the Battle of Winterfell in the third episode of this final season. This was probably the most solid relationship in the whole series, if we're being honest. Jorah loved his queen, and you can tell actors Iain Glenn and Emilia Clarke have soft spots for each other as well.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Cersei and Missandei</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Sure, Cersei may have ordered the beheading of Missandei, but in real life, Lena Headey and Nathalie Emmanuel are buddies. Headey's caption reads, "You represented hope and true strength. I didn't like that day up there." Awwwwww.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Arya and the Night King</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Could you imagine just hanging out on set with the Night King? Stuntman and actor Vladimir Furdik — the Night King himself — posted this cheery photo from set with his cold-blooded killer. I bet it's really hard to smile under all those prosthetics and makeup.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Two dudes on a beach</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>This looks about right for two guys who just filmed a scene where they beat the crap out of each other. They're tired, they're bloody, and they're sweaty, but they're still looking gooooood. Pilou Asbæk (Euron Greyjoy) posted this photo on his Instagram, even though he's "the man who killed Jaime Lannister."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. A set visitor</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Oh my gosh. There is so much going on in this picture Emilia Clarke posted to Instagram. First of all, is that <a href=#>the notorious coffee to-go cup</a> that ended up in that shot? Second of all, Jason Momoa just popped by set to say "hi" to everyone?! That's beautiful. I'm not getting emotional, you are! Third of all, what is that hat he's wearing? It's a crime that this photo is cropped where it is.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Legs for days</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>While Euron Greyjoy is easily one of the most hatable characters on Game of Thrones, Pilou Asbæk seems like a straight-up delight. He's goofy and funny and from this picture, I can tell he also has really good legs.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. A boy and his butler</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>This picture, which Bran himself (Isaac Hempstead Wright) posted, would be a very... different direction for the show to have taken. In an alternate universe, Bran and the Night King become friends, the Night King cares for Bran, and they travel the world together getting to know each other and learning life lessons.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. Bald and stressed</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Emilia Clarke posted this <a href=#>after episode 5 </a>of the last season aired and wrote, "This is what it took not only to shoot ep5... but to watch it too!" I hear ya, sister! It stressed me out, and I wasn't even the one riding the dragon burning up thousands of innocent people!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. Bald buds</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>If you think about it, Game of Thrones should really be called Game of Wigs, because there's only one Iron Throne but there were about a million insane wigs throughout the run of the show. Here, Lena Headey and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau make funny faces in their bald caps before they get their serious wigs on and go back to business being very dramatic all the time.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10. Wigged and goofy</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Just kidding! Turns out these two know how to be goofy even with their wigs on! Incest isn't cute, but Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Lena Headey as Jaime and Cersei Lannister totally are. Those two really seemed like they had fun together on the show. This is the way Nikolaj decided to send off his "sister from another mother" on Instagram, and we love it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11. Set nap</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Sophie Turner shows us the less exciting side of being on set with this picture of her fast asleep, mouth open, probably dreaming of actually sleeping in a real bed. These actors have worked so hard for so long to bring us this epic show. I'm glad they'll finally be able to get some shut-eye.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12.

And then she pans around a makeshift black screened shelter and a couple of her coworkers, sitting and staring at their phones. For that is life on a television set.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">13. Rain, rain, go away!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>When you do things like shoot television shows outside, sometimes the weather doesn't quite cooperate. And so you have to put on a really silly-looking rain cap to protect your wig. Emilia Clarke is a real trooper.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">14. True love</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, in all his Mountain makeup, poses for a cute side-by-side with his wife, Kelsey Henson. It's got to be so weird seeing your husband all zombified and ready to fight his brother to the death!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">15.

Throwback to day one</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Maisie Williams recently posted this throwback picture of her on set on her first day of Game of Thrones. Oh, how far we've come! We've literally grown up with these people. Are you ready to say goodbye? Because I'm not.
