Here's a breakdown.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>We’ve been watching <a href=#>The Voice</a> for 21 seasons now, but sometimes it's good to have a refresher when it comes to the rules of the game. As contestants move into the Battle and Knockout rounds, "steals" and "saves" become a major part of the competition.</p><p>These aspects can greatly alter the outcome of each round and play an integral role in how the show goes down once they're implemented. With that being said, scroll down for a quick cheat sheet on the art of the steal and save.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How many steals do coaches get on 'The Voice'?</h2><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Country Living</a>, the coaches can each steal two artists from other teams during the Battle round. They also get one additional steal during Knockout rounds. It’s important to note that a contestant can only be stolen if they lose their battle. Winners of each battle automatically stay with their initial coaches.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, how exactly do steals work?</h2><p>If multiple coaches press their buttons to steal a singer, that artist can choose which team they’d like to join. If no one presses a button, that individual is eliminated from the competition. The Voice producer Mark Burnett <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">previously said</a> of the steal, "It’s been a very kind experience. We try to create a very kind experience on this show where people who deserve to stay have a chance to stay."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How many saves do judges get on 'The Voice'?</h2><p>When it comes to saves, the format is relatively similar to how things go with steals, except each coach gets just one save in the Battle rounds and one save in the Knockout rounds.</p><p>During the Knockout rounds, each celebrity coach is given the chance to save a member of their team that they had eliminated.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Recently, the show saw its first-ever case of a triple-steal-plus-save</h2><p>Although the steals and saves on The Voice can sometimes get heated, the process behind them is usually quite straightforward. However, the Oct. 11, 2021 episode of the show saw the first-ever triple-steal plus a save in the show's history.</p><p>Team Kelly's Kinsey Rose, and the Girl Named Tom trio, made up of siblings Bekah, Joshua, and Caleb, performed The Eagles' hit track "Seven Bridges Road," and the performance was jaw-dropping.</p><p>Although Kelly named Girl Named Tom the winner thanks to their "family harmony," she was quick to hit her save button for Kinsey, claiming she still "wants [her] on [her] team."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>Kelly wasn't the only one who was struck by how good Kinsey's performance was. Her three fellow judges each used their steals as well, which was the first time in the show's history that a contestant received three steals and a save during the Battle rounds.</p><p>"This is the first time in Voice history that we had four button pushes in the Battles and that just shows you the power of Kinsey’s voice," judge Blake Shelton commented on the situation.</p><p>Ultimately, Kinsey ended up deciding to stay with Team Kelly, which elated the singer and judge. "I’m really happy. All the steals in the world couldn’t remove her from my grasp," Kelly said after doing a little victory dance.</p><p>Catch new episodes of The Voice on Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EST on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecyapbJlo6myorjSZqanZaSdsm7CzqKang%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./police-rescue-50-foreigners-suspected-to-be-victims-of-kidnaping-in-lagos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Police Rescue 50 Foreigners Suspected To Be Victims Of Kidnaping In Lagos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-is-the-challenge-40-battle-of-the-eras-filmed.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Battle of the Eras Filmed?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
