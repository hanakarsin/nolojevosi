To us reading this in the age of Twitter, that unfortunate phenomenon is nothing new.</p><p>For a quick recap on the events of the July 27, 1996, thousands of attendees of the Olympics were gathered in the Centennial Olympic Park, which was designed as the meeting ground, or "town square" of the universal sporting events.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros</span></figure><p>At some point after midnight, Jewell discovered a green backpack containing a pipe bomb and alerted the Georgia Bureau of Investigation before calling 911, then cleared the area so that the package could be investigated while posing the least danger to the community.</p><p>Indeed, the bomb detonated 13 minutes after Jewell's 911 call, killing two people (one of whom was a camera man who suffered a heart attack while running to cover the events), and injuring hundreds of others.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Richard Jewell was profiled as a lone bomber, but he was innocent.</h2><p>Unfortunately for Jewell, the fact that he fit the criminal profile of a "lone bomber" meant that the media focused solely and aggressively on him as the prime suspect.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros</span></figure><p>Unsurprisingly, the police did this as well, and manipulated Jewell into waiving his constitutional rights, even going so far as fooling him into thinking he was taking part in a "training film" about bomb detection, rather than alerting him to the fact he was in fact being investigated.</p><p>Meanwhile, the media played their own part in painting a picture of Jewell as a failed law enforcement official who planted the bomb so that he could heroically "find" it and save the day.</p><p>The real perpetrator was Eric Robert Rudolph, a terrorist who committed a series of bombings between 1996 and 1998, and who was only caught in 2003 after spending half a decade on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.</p><p>To date, Rudolph remains incarcerated for four consecutive life sentences, while Richard Jewell passed away in 2007 at the age of 44.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the media and law enforcement completely tarnished his good name and reputation, our hope is that the new film will set the record straight.</p><p>Richard Jewell premieres on Dec. 13, 2019 at a theater near you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrK60edGimqGZopl6q7HWnqOlZZmju7CvxKer</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-wrestlemania-37-canceled.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>WWE's Major Event of the Year Is WrestleMania Is WrestleMania 37 Canceled?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./valentino-kemper-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Valentino Kemper - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
