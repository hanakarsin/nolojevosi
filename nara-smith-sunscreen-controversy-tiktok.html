We all burn pretty easily so we went with something with a little bit more SPF. He started by adding some coconut into his bowl. He's a baker so he makes sure that everything is very precise before moving onto adding some beeswax."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@naraazizasmith href=#>@naraazizasmith</a><p>ü§ç <a title=fyp„ÉÑ href=#>#fyp„ÉÑ</a> <a title=easyrecipe href=#>#easyrecipe</a> <a title=sun href=#>#sun</a> <a title=fromscratch href=#>#fromscratch</a> <a title=skincare href=#>#skincare</a> <a title=marriage href=#>#marriage</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Just Give Me One More Day - Alej" href=#>‚ô¨ Just Give Me One More Day - Alej</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @naraazizasmith</span></figure><p>She continued listing ingredients, then said, "Once all of that was combined in the bowl he added some ... oil as well. He then filled a pot with some water before placing it on the stove, letting it come to a boil, and placing the glass bowl on top of that."</p><p>Nara kept speaking in a low register into the microphone: "He continuously stirred until everything was melted and combined. Once it was taken off the heat, he added some zinc oxide powder to that before whisking it all together for about a minute just making sure that's all coming together." Lucky can be seen constantly whipping together the boiled ingredients into the DIY sunscreen Nara requested that he make.</p><p>"Once everything was combined he transferred it over to a glass jar before closing that and popping that in the fridge to solidify. About an hour later it was all solid and ready to apply," she said.</p><p>According to the content creator, the concoction was great.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @naraazizasmith</span></figure><p>"This went on so smooth and didn't leave a white cast," she says before the video cuts off as she shows off her husband's arm, which shows no white streaks.</p><p>Throngs of viewers who saw the video expressed their shock, with some swearing that the model must be trolling to make "homemade sunscreen." A verified TikTok dermatologist wrote, "NARA PLEASE" along with a crying emoji.</p><p>Some have jokingly asked Nara to make Ozempic from scratch, but it seems that the source of the controversy has to do with the fact that there are a lot of folks calling her out for encouraging people to make their own sunscreen.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">A number of people have called out Nara Smith for DIY sunscreen, calling it potentially dangerous.</h2><p>Content creator and esthetician Alicia Lartey said playing around with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sunscreen could lead to issues with people's skin</a>, and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a> posted a TikTok of its own quoting dermatologists who said that Nara's advice is a "terrible idea" who "say the ingredients Nara used may be an SPF 2 or 3 but not SPF 30."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @naraazizasmith</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a> even posted an article stating that Nara's sunscreen video was giving "experts pause" and that many expressed concern over her post.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour</a> also spoke with dermatologists to see what they had to say about Nara's homemade sunscreen, and they all unanimously advised against it.</p><p>"DIY sunscreen should be avoided as there is no way to know how effective the formulation is and how much protection it will actually provide.
