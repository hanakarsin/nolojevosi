But despite the numerous officials who have called for his resignation, it looks as though President Trump has no plans to step down from office.</p><p>Since Jan. 6, he has been <a href=#>banned from multiple social media sites</a>, with Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram being some of the biggest names on the list. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PBS</a>, instead of considering a step down from office, he will use his final days in the White House to highlight his achievements while in office, as well as "lash out" against the social media companies that have restricted his presence.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">President Trump's State Dept. page briefly said his term ended on Jan. 11.</h2><p>Rumors that President Trump had finally submitted his resignation began swirling after his biography on the State Department's website was changed, claiming his term was ending.</p><p>In place of the bio that usually occupies the web page, bold text read "Donald J. Trump's term ended on 2021-01-11 19:49:00."</p><p>This edit was made before Jan. 11 at 7:49 p.m., leading some to wonder if he had submitted his resignation privately.</p><p>"Hey, @StateDept, what do you know that the rest of us don't?" BuzzFeed News correspondent Christopher Miller <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> with a screenshot of the website.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BuzzFeed News</a>, Vice President Mike Pence's page was also changed similarly, stating "Michael R.

BuzzFeed News reported that a "disgruntled employee" made the adjustments to the web pages, via the site's content management system, and "It's 100% not a hack."</p><p>The matter is reportedly being investigated internally by the State Department, though it's unclear who exactly was behind the edit.</p><p>At this time, it does not look as though the current sitting president has any plans to step down before his term ends on Jan. 20.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbaledOrrKaoXaeytLXGpw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1118264-english-speaking-countries-africa-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>English speaking countries in Africa</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-buhari-hasnt-signed-electoral-bill-revealed.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Buhari Hasn't Signed Electoral Bill Revealed</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
