It's no secret that <a href=#>airlines</a> are doing everything in their power to ensure that economy passengers have the least comfortable seating experiences <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">imaginable as legroom is constantly shrinking</a>.</p><p>The more folks that are packed into a plane means that there's a greater opportunity for someone to be up in your grill, which means that if you're bringing any devices or items on board, you have to account for space. The inconvenience of extricating them from your bag without disturbing anyone else around you, and having enough room in front of you to use said device.</p><p>And while smartphones are constantly increasing in size, they're pretty handy devices for entertainment when you're on an airplane, even if you don't have WiFi. There are plenty of ways to download movies or have a bunch of games handy to keep yourself busy when you're up in the air, and many airlines have opted for mobile applications instead of built-in TV screens for entertainment options.</p><p>This <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor</a> decided to provide their own entertainment on a flight, but his choice in cinema ultimately angered a mom on board.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit | @movieplanethrowaway</span></figure><p>An anonymous user who posted under the name @movieplanethrowaway told the story of a young child inevitably snooping on the movie he was watching while on-board the plane, which resulted in a dramatic situation. He asked a bunch of users in the social media site's popular "AITA" sub if he was in the wrong for watching Deadpool 2 during his flight.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit | @movieplanethrowaway</span></figure><p>The Redditor writes: "I, 19m, was on a flight to visit my parents. I had a few movies downloaded on my phone, including the second Deadpool. I was watching it on my phone with headphones in, when the part where Deadpool gets ripped in half happens, and I can hear a (muffled) scream behind me."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit | @movieplanethrowaway</span></figure><p>He continues: "I take out my headphones and there's a little kid behind me, crying. He had positioned himself in a way that he could watch my screen and had watched him get torn. His mom got mad at me and yelled that I shouldn't be watching that kind of thing, especially in front of children. But I wasn't aware anyone was watching me, and that kid would have had to force himself into that weird position to see my phone screen. So, AITA?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit | @movieplanethrowaway</span></figure><p>He clarified in an edit in the post that this didn't occur during a night flight and it was the middle of the day and specified that the child in question was no more than 6 years old, so seeing someone get ripped in half was probably really traumatic for him to watch.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit | @movieplanethrowaway</span></figure><p>Throngs of Redditors stated that it was his personal device and he was entitled to watching whatever he wanted on it and it was basically up to the child's mother to ensure that they weren't watching content on other people's screens.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit | @movieplanethrowaway</span></figure><p>Some folks even suggested that OP come up with other ways to get back at the mother, like maybe pulling up similarly violent content on their phone to teach them a lesson about "snooping" and staring at other people's devices.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit | @movieplanethrowaway</span></figure><p>Others were just relieved to discover just what kind of "R-Rated" content the Redditor was viewing on his phone, stating that they could've understood where the child's mother was coming from if the content on OP's device was of a sexually explicit nature.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit | @movieplanethrowaway</span></figure><p>What do you think? Was OP in the wrong and should've considered that because airplanes squeeze folks together so closely that they should've been mindful of this and known that folks are going to have a full view of whatever he was watching on his phone? Or should people ultimately just mind their own business?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWquMNmmquxmaO0brnOr6CeZZahtqi00w%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-kamran-a-villain-ms-marvel.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Kamran a Villain in Ms. Marvel?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-isaak-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Isaak - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
