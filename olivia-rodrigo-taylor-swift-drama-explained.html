Olivia, who was riding off of the success of Disney Channel's <a href=#>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</a>, was just getting started in the music business and had been very open about her admiration of Taylor.</p><p>And in the beginning, Taylor seemed fond of Olivia, too.</p><p>When Olivia posted a video of her singing Taylor's song "Cruel Summer," Taylor reacted by posting Olivia's cover on her Instagram Story.</p><p>"Love this!"

Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, Olivia passed Taylor a sweet handwritten note that night, too. The ladies still seemed to be smitten with one another.</p><p>Later that month, Olivia's debut album "Sour" was released on May 21.</p><p>And fans learned that Taylor and her longtime writing partner <a href=#>Jack Antonoff</a> had actually gotten a writing credit on one of Olivia's tracks.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Olivia discussed why they received credits on the song "1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back" while on The Zach Sang Show on May 30, 2021.</p><p>"We interpolated ‘New Year’s Day,’ which is Taylor’s song from 'Reputation.' I came up with the '1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back"' concept and I sort of wrote a verse and a chorus," she said.</p><p>This basically meant that Olivia inserted chords from "New Year's Day" into "1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back." This is different from sampling as Olivia re-recorded the chords in a toned-down manner so they would sound similar to Taylor's, but weren't identical.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">July 2021: Taylor and songwriting partner Jack Antonoff quietly receive writing credits on "Deja Vu" after a rumored lawsuit.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>why does deja vu by olivia rodrigo sound exactly like cruel summer by taylor swift</p>— 🌸 (@imjustheregh) <a href=#>April 1, 2021</a></figure><p>In the weeks following Olivia's release of "Sour," fans started pointing out that there were similarities between Olivia's song "Deja Vu" and Taylor's song "Cruel Summer."</p><p>While Taylor and Jack already received credit on "Sour" for "1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back," it appeared that they also believed they deserved credit on "Deja Vu" and accused Olivia of copyright infringement.

This came after months of people comparing Olivia's song "Good 4 U" to Paramore's "Misery Business."</p><p>Ultimately, Olivia lost millions of dollars paying out royalties to Taylor and Paramore — which likely felt like a major blow after working so hard to put out her first album.
