I don't think I'll ever go sky diving, or climb Everest, or swim with a shark. Yes, I know that only about four people a year die from a shark attack but I still don't like those odds. I'm sure that if I were ever to see a shark in pain I would just say, "Well, that is just nature at work" and swim away.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, there are people out there who are braver and more empathetic than me. Diving instructor Bret Johnson recently saved a shark with a 12-inch knife sticking out his head that was found swimming near a reef in the Cayman Islands. While the idea of a shark getting in a knife fight is a scary thought to most of us, Johnson doesn't see it that way. "Obviously <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">something wasn’t right</a> and I moved in for a closer look," he said.</p><p>When he got there something pretty incredible happened. According to Johnson, "At that point, the shark turned around and settled right below me as if asking for help." And help he did. Johnson removed the knife from the shark who then swam off like nothing happened despite having a knife wound in his head.&nbsp;</p><p>Someone was around to record this moment on film.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Johnson think the shark was a nurse shark, a particularly docile and slow-moving member of the shark family, and one that is incredibly important to the local ecosystem. In fact, they are so vital that the Cayman <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">outlawed shark hunting</a> in 2015. Anyone caught harming a shark faces up to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">four years in prison and a $500,000 fine</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, this particular shark is still around doing his job for the local ecosystem. The Cayman Brac Beach Resorts saying in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook post</a> that "the shark seems to be doing all right and we even spotted him again swimming around the same reef."</p><p>While we still don't advice swimming near sharks, it is good to hear it all worked out this time.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">More from Distractify</h2><p><a href=#><u>30-Year-Old Evicted from His Parents’ House Gives the Cringiest Interview Ever</u></a></p><p><a href=#><u>These Shameless Girls Bragged About Stealing a Tip Jar — But the Internet Tracked Them Down</u></a></p><p><a href=#><u>This Girl Found out Her Boyfriend Was Cheating from a Jimmy Johns Delivery Guy</u></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJmenrqiuNJoaWlpZ2R9dHuPcWZqfmJ3mI17x6ijnWWppMKzecGrnJqsmGKur7CMsJitm5hiwam10maboq6Zo7Rutc2sq6utk6m8s3nSmq2eZZFiwKmt0aSqZqSZm7JurthmqZ6ln6u2r7OMmmSkppmbsm6%2F066apGWZo3qqwNJmn56ZlA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./239009-hii-ndio-orodha-ya-wanaowania-binafsi-ugavana-useneta-na-ubunge-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hii ndio ORODHA ya wanaowania binafsi Ugavana, Useneta na Ubunge</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./are-michael-keaton-and-diane-keaton-related.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Are Michael Keaton and Diane Keaton Related?
