it came out very clear and the cure, the immune booster, and the solution to a large extent was presented to us and we did what we are supposed to do, but the people probably didn’t hear us.</p><p>He also commended Madagascar, another African nation that also adopted the use of local remedies.</p><p>“I am very happy that the same thing that we are talking about in Nigeria, another sister country Madagascar has taken it upon themselves and even US government has even reached out to them for funding.</p><p>“It is another unfortunate thing that the international countries are reaching out to us on this our solution but even our local people are not reaching out to us and we have testimonials of a lot of people that have this ailment that we have used it for to heal them.</p><p>“It is a natural herbal and it is very effective, so, we decided to keep quiet and move to a stage of motorized fumigation and make it very mechanical.</p><p>“Our ancestors started fumigation, started sanitization; they used to call it ‘ero’ wherever you have ‘igbono ‘ in the olden days, our ancestors will say ‘e je ki a lo won ero.’ We are here to fumigate, so, what is the difference.</p><p>The traditional ruler explained that getting a cure for the infection and overcoming the pandemic is better than giving palliatives to the people.</p><p>“People will say why am I not sharing palliative, how many palliatives do you want to share, you can keep sharing and the thing keeps on dropping on your body; we are killing more people.</p><p>“We are so worried, it is a sleepless night for me; what I have just come to present today, it is a very very huge sleepless nights because we were fully prepared in a traditional way, it is not like we are not prepared and that is why it didn’t actually catch us unaware. So, the result will soon come out and we will announce it to the world.</p><p>“We are looking at the whole state in Nigeria. The issue is logistics, so, we are trying to cover the one we can cover within our ambit, but the major challenge is logistics.</p><p>“When I get to the point of hitting brick wall, I will shout to the whole world again that, please help us we have a solution, how can we reach to other longer places.</p><p>“For me, I am ready, I am willing to move, people are worried and afraid that I should be worried and afraid, but I said No, we have to do legacy for ourselves and rise up to the occasion to face this pandemic.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH11e5JpZpynoqS7osLIq6ysZaeaeri1y6Vkppmbmnqtu8Kao2abpaeybq3VmqClmZKhsm6%2FzqilZqefo7Zuu8VmoJ%2BdXZ67tLXSrapo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tuesday-motivational-quotes-for-work.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>35 Quotes to Give Your Tuesday a Boost (Plus, There's Tacos!)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tanner-buchanan-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tanner Buchanan - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
