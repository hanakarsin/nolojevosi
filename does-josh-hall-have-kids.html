He’s a devoted husband to Christina Hall and he’s the step-father of her three children.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @unbrokenjosh</a></figure><p>Christina Hall was once known only for being one half of <a href=#>HGTV</a>'s iconic <a href=#>Flip or Flop</a> duo. And, while she's still known for her role in the former home renovation show, her personal life has interested fans more than ever in recent years. And viewers of Christina in the Country are plenty curious about her husband, <a href=#>Josh Hall</a>.</p><p>We know he's now the step-dad to Christina's three <a href=#>kids</a> from her two previous marriages, but does Josh Hall have kids of his own? And furthermore, do Josh and Christina have plans to expand their family? It's hard not to wonder what the future holds for the pair as they continue to share their life with HGTV fans.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @unbrokenjosh</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Josh Hall have kids?</h2><p>Before Christina, Josh's life was very different. He was in real estate and lived a mostly unassuming life out of the spotlight. But now that he's part of Christina's world, he has fans of his own and many want to know who Josh is. He didn't have children before he and Christina got married and Christina appears to be his first and only wife. He was raised in a family of 11 other siblings, though, so he is no stranger to being around children.</p><p>It's safe to say that Josh's life changed considerably once he met and married Christina, but he's a devoted step-father now. He and Christina share most aspects of their life on social media and Josh is a big part of Christina in the Country too. He also stood behind his wife during her recent custody battle for her youngest son, Hudson, with her ex-husband, Ant Anstead.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @thechristinahall</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Josh Hall is the step-dad to Christina Hall’s kids from previous marriages.</h2><p>Although Josh didn't come into his marriage with biological kids of his own, he now helps Christina raise her three kids. And, Christina told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> in January 2023, Josh is especially close to her sons, including Hudson who she co-parents with Ant, and Brayden, whose father is Christina's first ex-husband, Tarek El Moussa.</p><p>Christina told the outlet that her sons "idolize watching [Josh] chop down trees" and that when it comes to home projects, "the boys just love being involved, especially Hudson."</p><p>As far as expanding their family, despite Josh being such a hands-on step-dad, Christina told People they have their hands full for the foreseeable future. She said they're currently "happy with the three" they're raising together.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @thechristinahall</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Christina’s ex Tarek El Moussa supports her relationship with Josh.</h2><p>Despite the very public issues Christina has had with Ant, her relationship with Tarek post-divorce seems to be on the upswing. In September 2021, when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> asked Tarek if Christina and then-boyfriend Josh were engaged, he had only positive things to say.</p><p>“I’m not a mind reader,” Tarek said at the time. “I’m just saying, they’re good together. I hope the best for them.”</p><p>Watch Christina in the Country on Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST on HGTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4yjpqygXZ2urbiMoZivnV2gtqW%2F</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./worst-tv-dads.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 9 Worst TV Dads From Sitcoms to Drama Over the Years</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-bola-tinubu-breaks-silence-on-his-health-status.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bola Tinubu Breaks Silence On His Health Status</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
