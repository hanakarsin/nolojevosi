Here's what we know about his loss.</h2><p>Dr. Phil's nephew, William Scott Madsen, Jr. (who most often went by the name Scooter), passed away on Friday, May 8 in Los Angeles, Calif. at approximately 47 years old. According to his obituary, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scooter had been battling cancer</a> for many years, and although his family did not specify what type of cancer he had been suffering from, or how long he had battled the fatal disease, he was described as "brave and determined" while undergoing treatment.</p><p>Scooter was born at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, grew up in Wichita Falls, Tex., and eventually moved to Hollywood, where he spent most of his adult life. He had earned a Bachelor's degree in clinical psychology at Midwestern State University, and went on to work as the Director of Research for Dr. Phil and The Doctors. He had been planning to propose to his longtime partner, Melissa Landrum, on July 4, 2020.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As Scooter had worked for Dr. Phil for several years, it comes as surprise that Dr. Phil didn't open up about this major loss on social media after it happened. However, it may have been too difficult for him to talk about, and everyone copes in their own ways.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dr. Phil and his wife have expressed that family is their No. 1 priority in life.</h2><p>Dr. Phil and his wife, Robin, are the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">proud parents of two adult sons</a> named Jay and Jordan, according to Baby Gaga, and they're now grandparents. Family is the most important thing to the McGraw clan, and although they each have their own interests, Phil, Robin, Jay, and Jordan make a point to prioritize "family time" over anything else.</p><p>“At this point, our family would probably be number one, then our relationship,” Robin once stated in an interview. “We spend a lot of time together, but we have our own interests separately.”&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Phil also expressed his love for becoming a grandparent, saying: “I’ve become that guy — if they didn’t have cell phones now with pictures, I’d be carrying around an album under my arm, so, we love that."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>RIP Scooter Madsen, you will be missed by the entire McGraw and Madsen family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmb9uvMeio2amlaW1psM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1385373-empress-njamah-bio-age-family-net-worth-career-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Empress Njamah bio: age, brother, parents, net worth, husband</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./thomas-sangster-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Thomas Brodie-Sangster - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
