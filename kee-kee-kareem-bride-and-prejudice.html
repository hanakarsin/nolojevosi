She also worried whether Kareem would be willing to properly care for Kee Kee's 6-year-old son, Jeffrey.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After spending time with Marvaline and showing Kee Kee that he would be there for Jeffrey, the two got engaged. But, the pair got into a blowout fight in front of the child on the April 15 episode, and the fate of their relationship was left hanging in the balance.</p><p>In a clip obtained by Distractify ahead of the April 22 episode, Kee Kee and Kareem decide to calmly finish the conversation that resulted from their big fight.

The fight was exacerbated further when Kareem brought Jeffrey up, and wondered who was thinking about the child's feelings.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The April 22 episode will showcase the continuation of that conversation, and how Jeffrey was really affected by the whole thing.

"Because he wanted you, he wanted his daddy."</p><p>Kareem then assured Kee Kee that he would never give up on Jeffrey. Even if the two don't manage to work out their romantic relationship, Kareem explained that he could never walk away from the child.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I was sitting there thinking — despite everything — that this is a little boy who loves me a lot. It would just be devastating for me to leave him. I couldn't do it in my heart. I just thought about that before I could leave, because I was just going to grab my stuff and go," Kareem told Kee Kee. "I'm extremely hurt, and I'm way past my breaking point to the point where, today, I let my emotions get the best of me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While Kareem was able to have a normal conversation with Kee Kee shortly after their big argument, he went on to explain that his emotions do oftentimes get the best of him.

For Kareem, having Jeffrey as part of his life is a huge motivating factor, but he's also realized throughout the process that he has a tendency to get really angry at Kee Kee.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I feel sad for how I blew up and how I hurt Kee Kee. I feel like I lost a piece of my soul with that. But I feel like it was something that was weighing so heavy on me. It was so heavy on me that I couldn't hold it anymore," Kareem said in his confessional. "I hold my emotions and I blow up sometimes. I wish that didn't happen at all, but I've tried my hardest throughout this process, and I'm throwing my hands up at this point."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>On the April 22 episode of Bride and Prejudice, it's Commitment Day, meaning that the couples will have to decide if they continue their relationships.
