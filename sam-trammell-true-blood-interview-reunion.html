The series premiered in 2008, bringing the main characters from the book The Southern Vampire Mysteries to television screens.&nbsp;</p><p>For seven seasons, viewers stayed glued to the storylines surrounding Bon Temps, La. resident and waitress Sookie Stackhouse (<a href=#>Anna Paquin</a>) who fell in love with Confederate soldier and vampire Mr. Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer).</p><p>The show followed an alternate America, in which vampires were "out of the coffin" and some were trying to be productive members of society. Throughout the series, the characters (and viewers) learned of other supernatural creatures roaming the Earth, including fairies, witches, shapeshifters, werewolves, and more.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>With numerous supernatural romances, tons of blood, and a lot of southern accents, the award-winning series was one of the best TV shows from the past decade.&nbsp;</p><p>And, it's no wonder that True Blood continues to have a large fandom of followers.</p><p>Distractify spoke exclusively with one of the stars of the series <a href=#>Sam Trammell,</a> who played Sookie's boss Sam Merlotte, for seven seasons. The actor dished on the possibility of a reunion or reboot, and what he doesn't miss about the series.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sam Trammell doesn't miss those infamous 'True Blood' nude scenes...</h2><p>If you're a fan of the show, you know that many of the characters were regularly covered in blood... and nude. In the series, the 51-year-old played the owner of the popular bar Merlotte's, and also happened to be a shapeshifter, meaning he was naked in a lot of his scenes.&nbsp;</p><p>The actor joked to Distractify that he certainly reminisces about his days on set and uses those memories when he films current projects.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>"When I’m on set and things get bad or I get grumpy or I get like, ‘Ah this is taking too long. I wish this and I wish that.’ I go, ‘Wait, you’re dry and you’re not cold and you have your clothes on,'" he said. "That was the worst, being naked, outside, and wet. Especially when you have sticky blood on, I think about that all the time."</p><p>He also explained that he doesn't miss trying to look good in front of the camera, which resulted in being "hangry" while filming.</p><p>"We used to call it being hangry, hunger bringing on anger. ... It was just like, ‘Who’s hangry today? Alright, Alex [Alexander Skarsgård] he’s gotta be naked.’" he recalled. Adding, "And all the nights too, we did so many nights. We shot in the canyons of Malibu where it’s 20 degrees colder than L.A. I shot so many freezing cold nights naked. ... Nuts, totally nuts."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">However, he would be down for a 'True Blood' reunion or reboot.</h2><p>Since the series ended in 2014, fans (including us) continuously hope HBO will reboot the series, or air a reunion special with the cast. When asked if he'd be down for either, Sam immediately replied, "Oh, sure!"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>He added, "That was such a special time in my life and all of our lives. It was such a ... it resonated and was such a popular show at the time. It was such a great experience for all of us."</p><p>The Homeland star explained that he doesn't get to see his former castmates that often, so reuniting would be "fun." If the show were to get rebooted, he added that he has "no idea what you would do" but "it would be fun to revisit that at some point."</p><p>Well, we're sure many "fangbangers" are just dying for HBO to bite...&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqK6uedOrmKallaG5bsDRrpxmmpykvKV5yKernqqmnrK4edGerKehn6M%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bobby-sands-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bobby Sands - Trivia, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./reactions-as-gov-makinde-donates-jeeps-to-oyo-pdp-leaders.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Reactions As Gov Makinde Donates Jeeps To Oyo PDP Leaders</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
