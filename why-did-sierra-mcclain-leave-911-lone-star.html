In fact, the show itself might be on its way out.</p>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jYKDjX hHZJHw">Jennifer Tisdale</a><p class="sc-bxLYvs cnDLfX">Published July 31 2024, 1:54 p.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It's been a somewhat rocky journey for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">9-1-1: Lone Star</a>, a spinoff of the wildly popular Ryan Murphy procedural drama 9-1-1. The first season of Lone Star premiered in January 2020 and ran through early March. Any conversations around the fledgling show were undoubtedly tabled while the world dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Despite that, the show returned a year later and kept that schedule until Season 5. Instead of staying on track and dropping in January 2024, the fifth season is scheduled to premiere in September. This was attributed to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, but there were also some heated contract negotiations that fanned the flames. Is that why <a href=#>Sierra McClain</a> left 9-1-1: Lone Star? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why did Sierra McClain leave '9-1-1: Lone Star'?</h2><p>In June 2024, while 9-1-1: Lone Star was in the midst of filming its long-awaited fifth season, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> reported that Sierra would not be returning to the show. We hope you got your fill in Season 4. The outlet said her exit had something to do with the intense contract negotiations, which could mean she asked for more money, and Fox was not willing to give it to her.</p><p>If social media is to be believed, several cast members may be frustrated by the financial discussions. Actor <a href=#>Robyn Lively</a>, who has a recurring role on the show, tweeted, "So excited to be a part of 9-1-1: Lone Star‚Äôs final season!! What a ride it‚Äôs been!" This was posted the same week Sierra's departure was announced and was quietly deleted.</p><p>While we're waiting to see how things shake out, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TVLine</a> revealed who is technically replacing Sierra's Grace Ryder in the call center. A new Season 5 promo shows Grace's son Wyatt (Jackson Pace) manning the phone lines. At the end of Season 4, he underwent spinal surgery after a biking accident. This meant he couldn't join his father in the field. Taking his mother's spot seems like a solid solution.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>From the set of Lone Star yesterday. It appears a lot of the cast and crew are saying their goodbyes as filming heads into its final week for Season 5. <a href=#>#911LoneStar</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OG2WwdhHNU</a></p>‚Äî 9-1-1 NEWS üêù (@911TVNEWS) <a href=#>June 29, 2024</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is '9-1-1: Lone Star' going to be canceled?</h2><p>The fate of the show is precarious at best. While neither Fox nor 20th Television have said a single thing about Season 6 or beyond, the cast has been dropping some cryptic hints on their socials, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TVLine</a>. In a since-expired Instagram story, Natacha Karam posted a photo from her trailer on set along with the caption, "Eight more shooting days left after five years on a show is a wild feeling. So much change on the horizon." Could that change be the end of the series?</p><p>The <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">@911TVNEWS</a> X (formerly Twitter) account <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">snagged a photo of a letter left by Jackson Pace</a>, who plays Judd's estranged son Wyatt. On June 29, 2024, they tweeted a picture of the note that was taped to a set piece. It read, "Thank you for making me feel so at home over the past few years! Finding my long-lost father, going to jail, having a baby, dropping out of college, getting in a life-altering accident. ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs been such a joy getting to do it all with you!" This certainly feels like a permanent goodbye!</p><p>Perhaps the most compelling post by a cast member comes from Brian Michael Smith, who plays Paul. He shared an adorable cartoon rendering of the cast to his Instagram stories, along with a link to a "save 9-1-1: Lone Star" petition. If that doesn't say something is afoot, we don't know what does. Here's hoping the show sticks around for many more seasons.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2armZq%2Fs62MppqcpJGeu264xJqtnmVpZn5uuM6nnGarpJa%2F</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./caroline-wozniacki-husband.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Caroline Wozniackis Husband David Lee Is an Ace</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sophia-ferrer-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Sophia Zionne Ferrer - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
