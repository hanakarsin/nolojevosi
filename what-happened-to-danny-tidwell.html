Danny Tidwell was only 35 at the time of his death on March 6 — but at the time the news first broke of his passing, it wasn't immediately clear what happened to him.</p><p>In the days that followed, however, more details about Danny's untimely death slowly emerged. Let's take a closer look at what happened to him, along with the legacy that he's left behind.

Back in 2007, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was named the runner-up</a> on Fox's third season of the dancing competition — behind Sabra Johnson. The late dancer was a member of the American Ballet Theater.</p><p>"When I was younger, I got into a lot of trouble. Getting the opportunity to dance really got me out of that," he said during SYTYCD.</p><p>Originally, Danny was from Norfolk, Va., and competed when he was 22 and danced contemporary style. The late dancer trained at the Kirov Academy of Ballet of Washington before training with his adopted mother.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Danny?</h2><p>In the wake of Danny's death, his husband — i24NEWS New York Correspondent David Benaym — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared a moving tribute for his husband on Instagram</a>.&nbsp;And in doing so, he also revealed what happened to Danny.</p><p>"I'm devastated that my Danny, the love of my life, my beloved friend, the artist, the talented angel, fierce mind, legendary dancer, my now late husband, Danny Tidwell died last night in a car crash while his friend was driving him home from work," David wrote next to a series of photos of Danny through the years.

I'm thinking of Denise, Travis, Scott, Tyler and Shannon, Grandma, his sisters Latoya and Ronda, his friend that was with him, Eddy, that survives him, and all his dance family that is already expressing the state of shock we are all in. We were so lucky to have him, life was so challenging for him. But he was a warrior, and he came back standing, always. We loved each other so much, he was and always will be family. He made me the happiest for so many years, we were able to create so much together, a book and a show, Moving Still, an amazing magazine adventure for 7 years, movmnt magazine, that made us so proud. He had such an impact on the dance world, life gave him so much to deal with from a young age. I will write more about you Danny, tell your story, continue your legacy, make sure that you are not forgotten, that you are celebrated. An angel with no wings you said you were, you were flying all along, and you'll be our guardian angel from now on. I love you, I'll forever miss you. You're now in peace, mon Danny, and I know you know how much you were loved. #dannytidwell</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>David BENAYM</a> (@benaym) on Mar 7, 2020 at 12:07pm PST</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Danny's brother, Travis, also confirmed his death via Instagram.</h2><p>Danny was adopted by Travis' mother, Denise Wall, when he was 12, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>.
