What happened? Here's what we know about Ken Block's <a href=#>cause of death</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What was Ken Block's cause of death?</h2><p>On Jan. 2, 2023, Hoonigan and local authorities announced that Ken died in a snowmobile accident near his ranch in Woodland, Utah. The Wasatch County Sheriff's Office in Utah revealed in a statement on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> that he was "riding a snowmobile on a steep slope when the snowmobile upended, landing on top of him." Ken was pronounced dead at the scene.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Hoonigan Industries also confirmed his death in a statement shared on social media: "It's with deepest regrets that we can confirm that Ken Block passed away in a snowmobile accident today. Ken was a visionary, a pioneer and an icon. And most importantly, a father and husband. He will be incredibly missed."</p><p>Ken co-founded the skateboard and snowboard brand DC Shoes in June 1994 alongside Damon Way and Clayton Blehm. After selling the company in 2004, Ken shifted his focus and moved into the world of rally. He quickly made a name for himself in the industry, eventually launching the Hoonigan brand and producing the beloved Gymkhana video series on YouTube.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Hoonigan Industries (@thehoonigans)</a></p></figure><p>"Ken was a legend in his ability to take a vision and make it a reality. He created an industry," Steve Arpin, Ken's teammate in the Nitro RallyCross series, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a>. "But if you were lucky enough to know him, that's where the best parts of Ken surfaced. He treated his friends like gold and would create opportunities for whoever wanted to put in the work. He was everything this world needs more of, and just happened to do a lot of really cool stuff on the side."</p><p>Action sports icon Travis Pastrana also spoke with ESPN, commenting that 2022 was Ken's year.</p><p>"Ken was so happy. At the races, he was happy to be racing with [his wife] Lucy and to have his daughter racing and to have his kids at most of the races," Travis added. "Few people get to the point in their lives where everything comes together, and to have it all taken away like this is devastating."</p><p>Our thoughts are with Ken's family, friends, and fans during this difficult time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLKvecGlppyjXZiutr%2FEZqafZZSarrW0</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./simon-whistler-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Simon Whistler - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./megan-knorpp-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Megan Knorpp - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
