Indeed, the two stars previously were romantically affiliated with one another. With that being said, let's break down the timeline of their relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Joni Mitchell and Graham Nash's relationship timeline is one for music history books.</h2><p>As two of the biggest stars of music's counterculture in the 1960s, Joni and Graham were fated to run into one another. The two's first encounter came in March 1968 after the Hollies, the band Graham was a part of at the time, performed a show in Ottawa, Canada.</p><p>In his autobiography Wild Tales, Graham recalled every detail of the night he and Joni met. "She was the whole package: a lovely, sylphlike woman with a natural blush, like windburn, and an elusive quality that seemed lit from within," he said of his feelings about her at the time. He approached her, they got to talking, and ended up back at her hotel.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Graham called that moment "a seduction scene extraordinaire." He said in his book that "She picked up a guitar and played me 15 of the best songs I’d ever heard, and then we spent the night together. It was magical on so many different levels."</p><p>Their encounter remained a one night stand until the end of 1968 when they saw each other again at a party David Crosby was hosting. The spark still remained, and Graham moved in with Joni.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Graham described their time living together using only positive terms. Their love allowed both of their creative minds to flourish, and the moments of domestic bliss they shared together at that time gave way to such CSNY hits as "Our House" years later.</p><p>Sometime around Woodstock in the Summer of 1969, the two began tossing around the idea of marriage. However, Graham was hesitant as he was already married once before, to Rose Eccles just three years earlier.</p><p>Cracks in their relationship really showed when CSNY went on tour in Europe accompanied by Joni. During a performance in Stockholm, Sweden, the band apparently made some anti-American comments on stage, which angered Joni. She and Graham got into an argument after the show and she poured a bowl of cornflakes with milk over his head.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Following the tragic 1969 death of bandmate David Crosby's girlfriend, Christine Hinton, Graham decided to accompany his fellow rocker on a 3,000 mile boat trip from Fort Lauderdale to San Francisco. Graham recalled in his book that the seven weeks they spent at sea was a "bottomless supply of weed and coke." When Joni met the two in Panama during a tour stop, the two got into an ugly fight that marked the beginning of the end.</p><p>After returning from his trip, Graham recalled that he received a telegram from Joni one night that read, "If you hold sand too tightly in your hand, it will run through your fingers. Love, Joan." That was the official end of their relationship.</p><p>Although their time together was torrid, it inspired some of their biggest individual hits. For Joni, the relationship gave way to "A Case of You," "My Old Man," and "River." For Graham, "Our House" became one of his most famous works.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7yvtYymoK2bmJq5rXnGq5ihmZ1iu6K%2Fx2apnqSRqbawutKhoKllpJ66prjIp5w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./breaking-atiku-clarifies-controversial-statement-says-tinubu-embarrassed-el-rufai.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Atiku Clarifies Controversial Statement, Says Tinubu Embarrassed El-Rufai</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-buhari-appointed-as-apc-presidential-campaign-council-chairman-full-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Buhari Appointed As APC Presidential Campaign Council Chairman (Full List)'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
