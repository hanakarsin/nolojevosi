Being tasked with protecting one of the most famous performing artists on the planet is no easy feat, but Julius has served the position flawlessly since he started working with the award-winning singer back in 2008.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Fans of Beyoncé are naturally curious to learn a bit more about the person who is tasked with ensuring her safety on a day-to-day basis. With that being said, let's take a look at the known details regarding who Julius is, his relationship with Beyoncé, and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What do we know about Julius de Boer, Beyoncé's security guard?</h2><p>As previously mentioned, Julius' relationship with Beyoncé and Jay-Z extends back to 2008 when he started becoming a frequent face in the singer's entourage.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his security company's website</a>, Julius was raised in Amsterdam. He has a degree from the University of Amsterdam as well. Europe was where Julius began his work in the private security field. He started his own protection company at just 24 years old and eventually expanded to include offices in New York, London, and Abu Dhabi.</p><p>In terms of iconic Beyoncé moments, Julius has been present for pretty much all of them. Beyond being present during all of her daily forays into the world as well as her concerts and live appearances, Julius has attended both of Beyoncé's baby deliveries and was even clearly present in the footage of Solange Knowles famously hitting Jay-Z in an elevator after the Met Gala.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> reported that Julius speaks five languages. On top of that, his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> suggests that his career strengths include "dignitary and executive protection, intelligence capabilities, risk assessment, crisis management, social media monitoring," and "VVIP worldwide transportation."</p><p>If one thing is clear, it's that Julius takes his job protecting Beyoncé as seriously as he would if he was protecting a world leader (which he kind of is).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While speaking with Variety in the aforementioned piece, Julius noted that "Adaptability, in physical and psychological terms, is the main characteristic that you must possess," when it comes to guarding someone as important as Beyoncé.</p><p>"It is much more than being a human shield to your customer," he noted. "You should always think three steps ahead, follow a schedule, and call ahead to destinations and so on."</p><p>All-in-all, Julius has excelled at thinking three steps ahead of anyone looking to get in between him and Beyoncé as the star has not had any major security compromises in the decade-plus that Julius has been employed by her. Even as her status has elevated into the highest echelons of fame, Julius has stepped up to the task and, well, guarded Beyoncé's body better than anyone else could.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn8KttdSsZJudqaS7pLGMrJycraKewbp5xq6Yq5w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./charlie-korsmo-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Charlie Korsmo - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./top-nigerian-newspaper-headlines-for-today-sunday-27th-march-2022.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Top Nigerian Newspaper Headlines For Today, Sunday, 27th March, 2022</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
