Does AGT have a live audience? Read on to find out when the latest season filmed.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does 'AGT' have a live audience?</h2><p>There are a few things that fans have come to expect for every season of AGT: entertaining performances, disagreements between the judges, and epic reactions from the audience members.</p><p>The talent competition has generally been filmed in front of a live audience in Los Angeles, Calif. The spectators bring a high level of energy to the set, and they tend to either cheer on or boo at those who are on stage.</p><p>In Season 15, AGT was one of the first shows to navigate production at the beginning of the pandemic. The series taped without an audience, there were no guest judges, and some segments were condensed.</p><p>Things improved for Season 16, but not everything is back to normal.</p><p>When the sixteenth season premiered with host Terry Crews and judges Heidi Klum, Howie Mandel, Simon Cowell, and Sofia Vergara, some viewers were alarmed to see the camera pan to a room with a full, maskless audience. Since California's mask mandate is in effect until June 15, many wondered how AGT got around the safety protocols.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>A representative for the NBC show told<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Good Housekeeping</a> that there was a "limited" in-person audience present throughout filming. As for the clips that showcase a full crowd, those are actually from past seasons of the series. Archived footage was added in for Season 16 in order to give viewers the level of energy that they've come to expect from the show.</p><p>Howie told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> that, though the audience was smaller for Season 16, it was still "wonderful" to get live reactions from people in real time.</p><p>"It was wonderful — it's like you've been lost forever, and now you feel like, 'I'm home,'" he said about getting the audience back. "Just to hear a reaction behind you, just to hear anybody be behind you and, kind of, affirm that what you just heard or what you just saw or how you just judged — they're either in agreement with [you], or they're totally opposed to what you just said."</p><p>The season was filmed in accordance with California's rules regarding COVID-19, and it features a mixture of "real and virtual shots."</p><p>It was also shot in one location in order to limit any potential spread, and to keep all of the performers and the judges safe.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When was 'AGT' Season 16 filmed?</h2><p>The sixteenth edition of the popular NBC competition commenced production in Pasadena, Calif. at the end of March in 2021. Filming concluded several weeks later, in April of 2021.</p><p>The auditions were virtual, though a special room was created to mimic the real experience. Once the group was narrowed down, the show continued with in-person performances.</p><p>America's Got Talent airs on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4yanq1lmJbDpnnAZqOirpVirrawyJ6lnJ0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dansby-swanson-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dansby Swanson - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-fenton-that-90s-show.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Fenton in Netflix's Sitcom 'That '90s Show'?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
