Plus, while Ellen occasionally talks to him on the show, she never even looks in his direction while speaking.&nbsp;</p><p>So, <a href=#>why is Andy outside on Ellen?</a> Plus, what is happening on The Ellen Show? Stay with us!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: youtube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why is “Average” Andy outside Ellen’s house?</h2><p>With the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, most shows in Hollywood have shut down production until further notice. However, many talk shows, including The Ellen Show, have figured out a way for the hosts to still record from their homes.&nbsp;</p><p>Ellen's requires the social distancing of her crew and staff, which is why, while the most famous lesbian you know is chilling in the comfort of her living room, executive producer "Average" Andy has been relegated to just outside the floor-to-ceiling, tinted windows.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Some fans</a> have found the circumstances hilarious, asking Ellen to “Send Andy to my house to clean my windows.” But others think Ellen should take her own advice to “be kind” and “give Andy a comfortable chair to sit in outside. Also something to drink.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: youtube</span></figure><p>But it appears to be all in good fun. As a core member of senior producers on the show, Andy is probably being well compensated for his time. And as long as the crew maintains social distancing, what’s the harm in a fun bit about how Andy can wash Ellen’s windows but not see into or enter her house? Well...</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Other members of 'The Ellen Show' crew range from upset to "furious".</h2><p>Unfortunately, not everyone on The Ellen Show has fared as fortunately as Andy Lassner. Crew members from the show, who operate separately from the writers and producers, were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"furious" to recently find out that they would be receiving a 60 percent reduction in pay and be left out of work</a>, despite the fact that the show continues to air.&nbsp;</p><p>To add insult to injury, The Ellen Show hired an outside, non-union tech company to tape from Ellen’s house, a fact that her regular crew only found out through social media posts from other colleagues.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>This is how we Saturday.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Ellen DeGeneres</a> (@theellenshow) on Apr 4, 2020 at 1:33pm PDT</p></figure><p>Additionally, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when Ellen returned to the air she told her viewers</a> that she felt it was important for her to return to work because of her “staff and crew."&nbsp;</p><p>"I love them, I miss them, the best thing I can do to support them is to keep the show on the air,”&nbsp;she said on her show.</p><p>However, the lack of personal outreach to crew members who’ve been with the show since its inception in 2003, along with a complete lack of transparency in communication and payments seem to tell another story.</p><p>In comparison, Jimmy Kimmel from Jimmy Kimmel Live! paid stagehands out of his own pockets and his show has been paying full rates since returning to air. Showtime’s Desus and Mero, which has been on the air just over a year, has also maintained transparency in communicating with their staff and is paying full rates.</p><p>While there are certainly different pay structures and economics that come into play for a daily talk show like Ellen’s, she is one of the highest paid stars on television with an annual income of almost $50 million and a reported net worth of $330 million.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZJqmlK56sMHTrKCdnV2ku26xy6Wcpw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./can-sofia-carson-dance.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Feel the Beat' Star Sofia Carson Is a True Triple Threat</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./victorious-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Victorious - Cast, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
