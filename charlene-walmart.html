She knows exactly how to pose to take the funniest photos for the Walmart in North East, Maryland.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Walmart Facebook pages are hubs of comedy on the internet. There, I said it. If you're sleeping on local Walmart Facebook pages, it's time to stop. The <a href=#>Walmart De Pere Facebook page</a> is a work of art. But right now, we're here to focus on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Walmart North East page</a>, run by the staff of the Walmart store in North East, Maryland, where one employee is taking product photos to new heights.&nbsp;</p><p>Her name is Charlene, and she is the best. many of the store's employees take photos with products in the store to highlight them on Facebook. But no one takes a product photo like Charlene. Hers are hysterical. One of a kind. And the fact that she's the only one doing silly things while everyone else just stands and smiles makes a scroll through the Photos section ten times better.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Charlene is often posing in these photos with a look on her face that says, "I cannot believe I am doing this. Who thought it was a good idea to get in a cart and cover me with cabbages? This is not funny." But you also know what she knows it's funny, and that's what's so funny about it. Does that make sense?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Charlene's a total ham! But she is also very keenly aware of how funny she is, which is too funny. The blank, not-smile on her face gets me every single time.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Charlene is proof that if you need to relax, take a load off, have some peaceful alone time, all you have to do is go to Walmart, grab a face mask, a robe, and a fuzzy pillow, and post up in a massage chair. Sparkling grape juice and a giant chocolate sampler doesn't hurt, either.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>It's not an easy task to get people excited about car tires, but Charlene knows how to make it happen. Like, I want to buy new tires for my car, and I just got new ones about a month ago. That's the effect Charlene has on people.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>I really don't know what to say about this picture other than that I have to assume it resulted in more people buying baby products from the Walmart in North East, Maryland. Charlene is such a hilarious presence that she's gone completely viral at this point.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Many of the pictures on the Walmart North East Facebook page have upwards of 1,000 likes and hundreds of comments. Charlene has now been featured on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Morning America</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And there's a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">petition</a> set up to get Charlene on Ellen. Out of 10,000 signatures, Charlene's got 9,711 so far!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>People everywhere can't get enough of Charlene. But if you're lucky enough to live in the area and shop at that Walmart, even better. "This is my Walmart and I see Charlene on the regular, and I love seeing this response to her pics!!" one person wrote on Facebook.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>I mean, come on. Have you seen anyone cooler? Her popularity has reached far and wide. One commenter wrote, "I live in Texas and will probably never get to meet Charlene but she is the reason I'm now following a random Walmart page that's originated thousands of miles from me."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>I know Charlene tries hard not to smile, but it seems like she's having an extra hard time keeping a straight face while surrounded by all these Valentine's stuffed animals. This might be my favorite picture of the whole bunch.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>I think it's pretty safe to say that Charlene is a star and deserves to at least make an appearance on Ellen. At the very least. For more Charlene highlights, head to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Walmart North East Facebook page</a>, and if you're in or around North East, Maryland, does anyone want to go to the store for me and get Charlene's autograph?&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWivsuepZ5lp5a5rq3RrQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1533511-video-2-1-shoes-viral-netizens-amused-by-unique-design-kind-smart-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Video of 2-in-1 Shoes go Viral, Netizens Amused by Unique Design: &amp;quot;This is Kind of Smart&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-jackie-blue-bloods.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Esposito's 'Blue Bloods' Character Was Unceremoniously Written off the Show</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
