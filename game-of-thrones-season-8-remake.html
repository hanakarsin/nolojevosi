Martin's epic fantasy books and could already be in for a reboot. After the Game of Thrones Twitter account&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mysteriously tweeted</a>&nbsp;"Winter is coming" on April 14, 2021, fans began to speculate about what the tweet could mean.</p><p>Due to the backlash from fans of the show around its Season 8, the most common theory for the tweet is that a Season 8 remake is in store — but is this theory just fantasy?&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is there a potential 'Game of Thrones' Season 8 remake?</h2><p>If you haven't already seen the epic finale of the well-beloved television show, here's a quick rundown of where we left off. The season was only six episodes long, and it largely consisted of original content compared to prior seasons, which had George R.R. Martin's books from which to pull plot points. Since he has yet to finish the final books in the series,&nbsp;<a href=#>The Winds of Winter</a>&nbsp;and A Dream of Spring, it was up to showrunners to fill in the gaps.</p><p>The series ends with answers to the two overarching series conflicts: the battle for the Iron Throne and the battle against the Army of the Dead, also known as White Walkers. In the first half of the season, protagonists Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, and their allies face off against the Night King to a somewhat anticlimactic end as Arya Stark stabs him.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Winter is coming.</p>— Game of Thrones (@GameOfThrones) <a href=#>April 14, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>In the second half of the season, Cersei Lannister gathers an army to take on Jon, Daenerys, and their allies. Daenerys leads the siege against Cersei and, in the process, loses a bit of her humanity. She defeats Cersei's army and kills both her and Jaime Lannister, but in a shocking turn of events, Jon puts an end to her destruction by killing Dany in return.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the united leaders of Westeros choose Bran as the new king, with Tyrion Lannister as the Hand of the King. Sansa Stark becomes Queen of Winterfell, Arya sails west beyond Westeros, and for his crime of killing the queen, Jon is sentenced to life north of the Wall. While this ending was bittersweet, many of the season's plot twists left fans disappointed.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>In light of universal fan disappointment in Season 8 and George R.R. Martin not yet completing The Winds of Winter, perhaps this is the opportunity HBO has been looking for to restore some faith in the Game of Thrones franchise. After all, Game of Thrones is turning into&nbsp;<a href=#>multiple spinoff shows</a>, and even a&nbsp;<a href=#>stage play was written by George himself</a>, so there's a lot of room for growth.&nbsp;</p><p>Until then, there has been no official word that Season 8 is getting a remake. It appears that the cryptic message is likely more to promote the new "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Iron Anniversary</a>" event on HBO Max, which celebrates the show being 10 years old. The Game of Thrones Twitter account is also asking fans to "MaraThrone" the entire series to raise money for various charities.</p><p>You can binge all seasons of Game of Thrones and a full reunion special on HBO Max now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnK6usYyonWasmKe8r7HSZqqemaOku26EjKucppmbmg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./deal-or-no-deal-island-season-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Deal or No Deal Island Is Coming Back for Season 2 Details</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./connor-liana-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Connor And Liana - Members, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
