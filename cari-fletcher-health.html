"I have recently been diagnosed with Lyme Disease. I started to become increasingly ill over the last couple years and just kept pushing even though I knew there was something deeper going on."</p><p>"For the last few months I've been receiving treatments, following the doctor's orders and doing my best to learn more about the invisible illness," she continued. "Lyme disease has affected me in a variety of ways and while it has not only taken a tremendous toll on my physical body, it has also cause concern for my voice as well. This has worn on my soul in a way that's hard to even put words to as singing is the thing I love most in this world and my voice is my vessel for expression."</p><p>Lyme disease is typically transmitted through infected ticks, and can cause a wide array of symptoms including fever, fatigue, headaches, and a distinctive skin rash. If it's left untreated, the infection can also spread to other parts of the body and become more serious. As a result of her diagnosis, Cari announced that she has postponed her shows in Australia and New Zealand until next year, and that she will have to cancel her Mexico City leg.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by FLETCHER (@findingxfletcher)</a></p></figure><p>"You all know how much I love performing and seeing you on the road and I'm truly heartbroken to let you down," her post continued. "I debated whether or not I wanted to speak about this publicly, but I've always let into my world through the good, the bad and the ugly and I didn't want to stop sharing with you now."</p><p>"Unfortunately touring and singing every night just isn't something my body is capable of in this moment and I want to show up for you all 100 percent and give you the best show that I know that I have in me one that you deserve," the post read. "It's not lost on me how incredibly fortunate I am to be able to take time off to rest, and take care of my voice and body."</p><p>For now, anyway, it seems Cari is taking the time she needs to focus on her recovery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6ztYyfo56sk52ys3nHnpilrJg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bobbikristina-brown-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bobbi Kristina Brown - Trivia, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./september11-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>September 11 Horoscope and Zodiac</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
