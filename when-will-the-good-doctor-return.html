When does 'The Good Doctor' return in 2023?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>If there's one thing viewers can't get enough of, it's medical dramas. From long-running series like <a href=#>Grey's Anatomy</a> to comedic spins on the genre like This Is Going to Hurt, folks can't seem to get enough of shows with heart (literally).</p><p>For the past five years, <a href=#>The Good Doctor</a> has invited us into a world where a small-town kid with a checkered past turns everything around when he moves to the big city to follow his dreams.</p><p>The series stars <a href=#>Freddie Highmore</a> as autistic surgeon Dr. Shaun Murphy and follows him on his ventures at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital. Despite his brilliance, the medical profession has not been easy for Shaun; we've witnessed him constantly struggle since the show began but he always bounces back.</p><p>Now halfway through Season 6 and heading into a break after the Dec. 12 episode, we're desperate to know when we'll see St. Bonaventure Hospital again. When does The Good Doctor return in 2023? It'll be a minute.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When will ‘The Good Doctor’ return in 2023?</h2><p>Break out your 2023 calendar or pull up the Google Calendar app on your phone, because after the Dec. 12 episode airs, we're not going to see The Good Doctor for about a month. That doesn't sound good at all! According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC</a>, Season 6 will resume on Monday, Jan. 23, at its regularly scheduled time of 10 p.m. EST. It also follows the premiere of <a href=#>The Bachelor</a>, so it'll be a thrilling evening of accepting roses followed by accepting diagnoses!</p><p>Easing into the winter break, things are looking predictably tense for the intrepid staff of St. Bonaventure. "I'm exploring," says Jordan (Bria Henderson) to Asher (Noah Galvin) after fessing up to a somewhat scandalous kiss. Asher's reaction is extremely concerning as he carefully tells Jordan to "be careful." We are promised a huge shock in this episode as well as the possibility that <a href=#>Audrey</a> (Christina Chang) could walk again!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Christina Chang respects what 'The Good Doctor' does for people with a disability</h2><p>In November 2022, The Good Doctor celebrated its 100th episode and actress Christina Chang celebrated her love for the show and its cast in a conversation with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Parade</a>. "I think what the show has done, and not just with autism but in any way, somebody feels challenged, is that it has provided hope," she said. "We’ve shown that when you have a community around you, of coworkers or friends and <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">family</a>, that you’re able to achieve almost if not all of, your goals."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span><p>The cast and crew of 'The Good Doctor' celebrate 100 episodes</p></figure><p>Christina's character has a complicated relationship with her body due to the fact that she went from being very physically active to living her life in a wheelchair. To honor her character, the actress worked with someone in a wheelchair to try and understand what that is really like: "He was fantastic in allowing me to find my own way in being a wheelchair user on the screen, and that was very helpful. I’m very grateful to him."</p><p>When they were shooting the 100th episode, the cast and crew took some time out of their day to bask in what it meant to reach that milestone. And before you ask, yes, there was cake. Everyone was hugging and congratulating each other. Their closeness really comes through in the show and is part of the reason it's so widely loved. "We have in common our love for Shaun Murphy and we <a href=#>root for his success</a> in love and at work," Christina shared.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmuoywoKWkXam1pnnGqKadZZSksLW70Wapnqylp7s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./burak-dakak-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Burak Dakak - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-joe-spano-sick.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Joe Spano Debuted a New Look on the Season 18 Premiere of 'NCIS'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
