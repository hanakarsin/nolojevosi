Bemba is spoken by more than two million Zambians and is used frequently in administration and education.</p><h3>4. Tanzania</h3><p class=align-left>With about 129 different ethnic groups, this anglophone country has what is probably the greatest linguistic diversity in the whole of Africa with four major African language bases, ranging from Bantu, Cushitic and the Nilotic languages to the less-spoken Khoisan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a73ac7b5bc510c97.jpg><p class=align-left>It is interesting to note that in all primary school education in the country is taught in Swahili, but when school children graduate from primary school and enter secondary school, the medium of instruction switches to English.</p><h3>5.

The three major indigenous dialect families in the country are Bantu, Central Sudanic, and Nilotic.

Sudan</h3><p class=align-left>Sudan has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">two official languages</a>, namely literary Arabic and English. The number of dialects indigenous to Sudan is estimated at 114 comprising more than 500different accents.</p><h3>8. South Sudan</h3><p class=align-left>Upon achieving independence, the Government of South Sudan <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">selected English</a> as its official language. This choice is understandable; given the linguistic and political history of the country, the current official English policy is a strong and predictable statement about national autonomy and political alignment.</p><h3>9. South Africa</h3><p class=align-left>There are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">eleven official languages</a> of South Africa. These include Southern Sotho, Pedi/Northern Sotho, Tswana, Swati, Ndebele, Xhosa, Zulu, Afrikaans, English, Venda, and Tsonga.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2agom8g1iii.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What are the features of culture in Nigeria?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f80aad64ca93a930.jpg><h3>10.

Seychelles</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The official languages</a> of the island nation of Seychelles are Seychellois Creole, English, and French. However, Seychellois Creole is the most widely spoken dialect in the country, and the vast majority of Seychelles residents identify as native Seychellois Creole speakers.</p><p class=align-left>Seychellois Creole is a French-based creole language and is locally referred to as Seselwa.</p><h3>12.

Ethiopia</h3><p class=align-left>Walking the streets of Addis Ababa, one can hear <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">many different languages</a> being spoken.

Furthermore, post-primary education is carried out entirely in English, which is, despite its prestige and widespread status, a foreign dialect to Ethiopians.</p><h3>24. Cameroon</h3><p class=align-left>Between 1916 and 1960, Cameroon served as the colony of both the United Kingdom and France. Though the nation is now independent, the legacy of the colonial past of Cameroon is visible in its selection of the official languages.</p><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">French and English</a> are the official languages of Cameroon. Eight out of the ten regions of the nation are francophones while two regions are mainly anglophones. However, the proportion of anglophones in the country is gradually decreasing.</p><h3>25.
