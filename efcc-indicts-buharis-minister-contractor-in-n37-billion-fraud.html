Okwete is associated with 143 bank accounts in 12 commercial banks in which 134 of the 143 accounts are corporate accounts linked to different companies.”</p><p>In 2020, the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission said it uncovered N2.67bn meant for the ministry’s school feeding programme in private bank accounts.</p><p>The former ICPC Chairman, Bolaji Owasanoye, disclosed that the commission unravelled N2.67bn in personal accounts, being payment made to some federal colleges for school feeding during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020.</p><p>Other discoveries by the ICPC include 18 buildings, 12 business premises and 25 plots of land. Owasanoye said under the Open Treasury Portal review carried out between January and August 15, 2020, of the 268 Ministries, Departments and Agendas, 72 had cumulative infractions of N90m.</p><p>The former ICPC chairman argued that the money was paid when children were not in school.</p><p>Despite requests by the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project to Umar-Farouq to publish details and names of the suspects, the former minister failed to reveal their names.</p><p>Reacting to this, SERAP had written on its official Facebook page, “Following the disclosure by the ICPC that N2.67bn meant for school feeding during the COVID-19 lockdown ended up in private bank accounts, we’re calling on the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development of Nigeria, Sadiya Umar-Farouq, to immediately publish details of those suspected to be responsible, or face legal action.</p><p>“If the names are not immediately published, we’ll issue a freedom of information request to ensure that those involved are named and shamed.</p><p>“We’ll also pursue appropriate legal actions to hold suspected perpetrators to account, in the public interest.</p><p>“Diverting funds meant to feed school children (who are already disproportionately affected by corruption), especially during COVID-19, is a blatant violation of the rights to education, health, and dignity, as well as the government’s own COVID-19 transparency frameworks.</p><p>“Corruption in school feeding increases distrust in the government. The Federal Government must ensure that transparency and accountability measures are fundamental to all school feeding and other initiatives in the context of COVID-19, to ensure the children receive the support they need.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5FtZp6ek5h6qrrDopqtq12Xwqmt0aKqZqWZo7a0wMSrZJynnqm%2Foq%2FTqKlmoZ5iu3SDjJugpaSZpLtustGarJ1n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-did-emily-from-corpse-bride-die.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Did Emily from Corpse Bride Die?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./derek-deso-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Derek Deso - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
