Jenna opens up about their relationship in her new book.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Channing Tatum</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenna Dewan</a> used to be a Hollywood dream couple. They met on the set of Step Up and were eventually married in 2009. Their daughter Everly was born in 2013, and then, seemingly out of nowhere, in 2018, they announced they were splitting up.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Channing leave Jenna?&nbsp;</h2><p>What went wrong for these two? Was it a mutual decision? Jenna offers some explanations and opens up about her experience in her new book called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gracefully You: Finding Beauty and Balance in the Everyday</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>This book is the first time she's speaking out about what happened between her and Channing. "[Divorce] was never on my docket of dreams," she wrote in her book, which was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">excerpted on E! News</a>, "but alas, here I am, learning and growing through one."</p><p>She explains that at first, she used all the "typical remedies" to feel better about the breakup, from drinking wine with friends to letting herself just cry it out. When the media got ahold of the story and the coverage became relentless, Jenna wrote that she was "in a state of shock... The pain hit my like a tumbling avalanche. I was completely overcome with fear and sadness."</p><p>Although she doesn't explicitly say why Channing and she broke it off, she does write, "I started to wonder if everything I believed in and always talked about was real. Could anyone or anything ever be trusted?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Very shortly after Channing and Jenna split, he made his relationship with Jessie J public.&nbsp;</h2><p>And Jenna found out about it just like the rest of us: over the internet. "I was learning things about my ex most people wouldn't have to face —&nbsp;and over the internet, as it was happening," she wrote. "There I was, on a plane, alone, finding out about his new relationship. I felt blindsided. Choosing grace as I learned everything about my personal situation along with the rest of the world was really difficult."</p><p>Yeah, seriously. I can't imagine what it would feel like to see your ex announce a new relationship out of the blue while you were still reeling and confused about your breakup. It would affect everything you thought you &nbsp;knew about your own life.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, just about a year later, Jenna is in a much better place. She's happily in love with her new boyfriend, actor <a href=#>Steve Kazee</a>. And the <a href=#>couple is expecting their first child together</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jenna announced that she was pregnant on September 24, 2019.</h2><p>"Becoming a mother is quite simply the absolute best most incredible thing that has ever happened to me," she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Instagram</a>. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@Stevekazee</a> you are a gift from above and I couldn't be more excited to be expanding our family together...! Thank you guys for all the love!!"</p><p>Not going to lie, Jenna Dewan seems like an amazing woman, and Steve seems like a great guy. She has been through a lot and handled it with immense amounts of grace. I'm so glad she's found peace and happiness.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenna told People magazine</a>, "You would never expect your life to take a turn the way it does. But embracing it and starting fresh and figuring out what you want in life and what means a lot to you... I'm grateful that I now am at a place where I understand myself and what I want and I'm happy about this new chapter."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2abmJa7r7XNoGSlnZGrsm62xKelmg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1180847-latest-turban-styles-nigeria-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Latest turban styles in Nigeria</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-ben-savage-married.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Ben Savage Married?
