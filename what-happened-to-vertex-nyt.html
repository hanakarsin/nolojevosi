The website offers a collection of puzzle games, including the rage-inducing <a href=#>Connections</a> and the previously-purchased <a href=#>Wordle</a>, each offering the user anywhere from a couple of minutes to an hour of head-scratching puzzles (depending on how many they do).</p><p>Vertex has been one of the standard games included in The New York Times games section, but unfortunately, some users are reporting being unable to find it on their NYT Games app. Others who access it on The New York Times app have also reported it missing, leaving many wondering what happened to the game.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: New York Times</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Was Vertex removed from the NYT games?</h2><p>Players on Reddit have shared varying reports of the game being unavailable on the various apps associated with the outlet, though it seems to differ from device to device. Unfortunately, it just seems that the game has been taken down from the apps, meaning players can no longer play Vertex alongside Connections, the Mini, Sudoku, and others.</p><p>That said, it has not been removed from the outlet's games section. Those who want to play Vertex will just have to access the game through the desktop version of the website, or through their mobile device's browser.</p><p>The game is still available to players, but as it's not as popular as some of the other games available through The New York Times, it seems the outlet may have just made room for other games, like Strands, which was recently added to the app.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>July 19, 2024.

Players are presented with a partially finished picture and some dots, each with numbers inside of them. The numbers inside these dots indicate just how many times the player has to connect a line to that dot to successfully complete the picture.</p><p>Though this may seem simple enough, some of the final results are incredibly intricate and can take quite a bit of time to get right.</p><p>Unfortunately, not every game included in The New York Times's games section is available for free. Some of the games, like the daily crossword, require a subscription to complete. Others, like Wordle and the Mini, are free to play regardless of a user's subscription status.</p><p>Those with a games subscription to The New York Times, though, will have access to all of the various games available on the website, as well as the archives. This means players can go back and complete old puzzles once they've worked through all of the new puzzles of the day.</p><p>Despite the apps trying to make these games more easily accessible for users, Vertex fans will have to use their phone's browser to keep up with its daily puzzles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSvnaKpsrl5zbKr</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wike-blasts-nigeria-governors-apc-governors-over-insecurity.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wike Blasts Nigerian Governors, APC Governors Over Insecurity</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fg-suspends-emirates-flights-from-nigeria.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>FG Suspends Emirates Flights From Nigeria</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
