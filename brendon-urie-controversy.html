At The Disco frontman is in hot water over new allegations of inappropriate conduct — which have brought up even more controversy.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>In the wake of accusations of sexual misconduct by Panic! At The Disco guard <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zack Hall</a>, the band is facing yet another major <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">controversy</a>. Frontman <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brendon Urie</a> has been accused of sexually assaulting a minor. With the rise of the new allegations, Urie's history of racist, sexist, and ableist actions, in addition to other times in which he touched someone without their consent, have come back to light.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brendon Urie's latest controversy revolves around a new sexual assault allegation.</h2><p>At the end of July, Urie was urged to speak up when band member Dallon Weekes' wife Breezy Weekes came forward to say that she faced sexual harassment by Panic! At The Disco bodyguard Zack Hall. He neglected to do so, and now he is being asked to speak up again, this time as he faces his own allegations. Twitter user @kam02700814 shared the experience he had with Urie in 2009.</p><p>Though he informed Urie that he was a minor, Kam says that Urie asked if he'd ever made out with a man before. When he said no, the singer then lamented that he tried to make out with his band member who wouldn't let him. When Urie attempted to touch Kam's thigh, he says that he ran away from the singer.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#BrendonUrieSpeakUp</a> here’s the accusations so people can find it. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ckf7wgGzU2</a></p>— 🍁 𝔇𝔯𝔞𝔪𝔞 𝔠𝔩𝔲𝔟 🍁 (@YuhShadeclub) <a href=#>August 13, 2020</a></figure><p>In the wake of Kam's statements, more accusers have come forward. Twitter user @leah62053062 says that she had a similar thing happen in 2011, when she was 15. As her friends left a concert to attend a party, she says that she was invited backstage, where she met Urie. When he called her beautiful, she responded that she was 15, to which he responded, "I didn't mean it like that. Can I not compliment a beautiful girl?"&nbsp;</p><p>She says, though, that after sitting on a couch and talking together for a while, he began placing his hands on her inner thighs. He then kissed her neck and attempted to grab her butt. She says that she ran out quickly when she felt him touch her genitals.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">These allegations have caused more past controversy to come back up.</h2><p>While many of us regret things we've said or done in the past, Urie's track record is pretty disturbing. According to Meaww, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Urie reportedly made racist, misogynist, transphobic, and ableist comments</a> in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>At one point, he also may have admitted to reportedly sexually harassing former Panic! bandmate Ryan Ross.&nbsp;</p><p>Twitter user @dinasapphic tweeted Urie's long list of shocking offenses, and honestly, things aren't looking good for him.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>actually im just gonna make a thread of shit brendon urie has done for the next time i have to argue with one of his stans</p>— alex 8 nsfr (@dinasapphic) <a href=#>April 15, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Brendon Urie use the N-word?</h2><p>Using the N-word is never acceptable, even if it's just a lyric in someone else's song, and fans have caught Urie singing it on various occasions. According to @nerdjpg he was caught <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">doing this during a livestream</a>, and @dinasapphic called him out for doing so as well.&nbsp;</p><p>@dinasapphic also noted that Urie decided to recite Chris D'Elia's monologue "I Wish I Was Black" at one of his concerts, with no additional context. Fans were confused by this seemingly misplaced reference, and perceived it as seriously tasteless.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I found this one of him mouthing the n word but he’s done this multiple times at least once more on periscope but I can’t find it. If you search “brendon urie n word” on twitter people say he did it at the time the live stream happened <a href=#>https://t.co/EiPsBO3U6e</a></p>— alicia (@nerdjpg) <a href=#>July 11, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">On multiple occasions, Urie has joked about raping fans.</h2><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a disturbing video</a>, Urie can be seen on stage saying, "If I see you after the show, I'm gonna f--k you. I don't care if you want it. I more care if you don't want it. Because then I really want it."</p><p>In another video, he can be seen talking about having wet dreams about his audience members, who @dinasapphic notes are primarily underage women. He goes further, explaining to those who don't know what a wet dream is that he's "straight up gonna f--k you in my dreams."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">He exhibited disrespectful behavior to the LGBT community.</h2><p>Although Brendon Urie has since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">come out as pansexual</a>, he has said some relatively questionable things about the LGBT community in the past. In a past interview, he appeared to fetishize bisexuality, saying it was "attractive," despite still <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claiming he was straight</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Many also feel he inappropriately poked fun at the trans community. When someone asked if he was a 9-year-old in skinny jeans and leather, he responded the comment was "offensive to 9-year-olds, jean-gendered and leather-gendered people."&nbsp;</p><p>At one point in 2015, Urie also apparently compared Caitlyn Jenner and Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who lied about being black and transracial, via Periscope. He also joked that, if he was born with a penis and a vagina, he would get nothing done because he'd play all day.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">He's also under fire for laughing at an ableist joke, and for reportedly making sexist comments.</h2><p>@dinasapphic called out Urie for laughing at an ableist joke reportedly made by Hall about a nun with Down Syndrome. While he didn't make the comment himself, the Twitter user felt he didn't have to egg on the joke in the manner that he did.&nbsp;</p><p>He has also made sexist and slut-shaming comments in regards to his song "Miss Jackson." While on stage, he described the song as being about "a girl I used to f--k. Yeah, I had sex one time. It was cool. But then she started to f--k all my friends while we were f--king." @dinasapphic noted that this was even more problematic considering it references Janet Jackson's "Nasty," a song about women's empowerment.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>a white woman wearing a war bonnet (around 2:55) in the miss jackson mv (a song about slut-shaming a woman who slept with his friends) miss jackson ALSO references janet jacksons song "nasty," which is about women empowerment. you see the issue here, yeah? <a href=#>https://t.co/1JVTtHmph3</a></p>— alex 8 nsfr (@dinasapphic) <a href=#>April 15, 2020</a></figure><p>He can also be seen on video making additional comments about women such as, "To all the desperate girls on Vine, show us your boobs and that would be just fine."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Urie also may have admitted to kissing a former bandmate without consent.</h2><p>Urie calls it "stage gay," others call it sexual assault. Apparently, the singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted to kissing his former bandmate, Ryan Ross,</a> on the lips and on his neck on-stage, despite the fact that Ryan said he didn't like it, according to @dinasapphic. He also admitted to doing this in front of their friends, after drinking a few beers.</p><p>Additionally, @dinasapphic noted Urie said men should come out about their #MeToo stories, despite the fact that he outwardly admitted to making passes at Ryan against his will.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>tw//sexual assault</p><p>while we're on the topic of ryan ross, brendon urie pretty much admitted to sexually assaulting him in the same interview he came out as pansexual (paper mag) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bMAAUR1fie</a></p>— alex 8 nsfr (@dinasapphic) <a href=#>April 15, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>tw//rape</p><p>ironically, right after he admits to this, he speaks about how important it is that men come out with their stories (<a href=#>#MeToo</a> movement) right after silencing ryans. brendon KNOWS his influence & fanbase is much larger than ryans, and if it came down to brendon vs ryan,- <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/T7jIB1Db59</a></p>— alex 8 nsfr (@dinasapphic) <a href=#>April 15, 2020</a></figure><p>Fans continue to ask for Brendon Urie to speak up and address the many allegations against him.</p><p><strong>If you need support, The National Sexual Assault Hotline is available 24/7 at&nbsp;1-800-656-4673.
