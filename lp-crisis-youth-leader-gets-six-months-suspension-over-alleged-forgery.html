Julius Abure has brought upon Mr Peter Obi and Yusuf Datti and LP generally.</p><p>“Fellow Nigerians, let it be noted that the National Executive Council of Labour Party is Not Aware of any report of the disciplinary committee that Barr. Julius Abure illegally acted upon, and neither was 2/3 majority of votes cast by NEC members nor was I, as National Youth Leader in attendance in such an NEC meeting that was not called.</p><p>“I definitely will not allow myself to be used as an instrument of distraction and destruction at this critical juncture in our nation’s history.</p><p>“Relevant authorities and security agencies in Nigeria shall hold Barr Julius Abure liable for whatever crisis that shall precipitate from this illegal action against me going forward.</p><p>“I am prepared to mobilize the youth of our great country to vehemently resist Barr. Julius Abure’s attempt to impose or parade anyone else as the Acting National Youth Leader of the <a href=# rel=noopener>Labour Party</a>.</p><p>“The Chairman of EFCC and relevant financial institutions in Nigeria are hereby put on notice to freeze all Labour Party Bank Accounts for immediate investigation as it affects fund mobilization by LP forthwith.</p><p>“The position of National Chairman of LP shall henceforth be ceded to Northern Nigeria since the party’s presidential candidate is from Southern Nigeria, while the position of National Secretary shall be ceded to Southern Nigeria,” Eragbe noted.</p><p>The national youth leader’s suspension was contained in a letter issued in Abuja by LP National Secretary, Umar Ibrahim.</p><p>It read, “You may wish to recall that on the 14th of October, 2022. The National Working Committee of the party met and has among other matters deliberated on the allegations of misconduct labelled against you as the National Youth Leader of the Labour Party. A disciplinary committee was constituted to look into your matter and report to the National Chairman.</p><p>“Consequently, the committee has submitted its reports to the National Chairman with its recommendations in accordance with the party’s constitution as Amended (2019).</p><p>“In compliance with the party’s constitution, as Amended, (2019) and the committee’s recommendations, you are hereby suspended from your duties as the National Youth Leader of the Labour Party for a period of 6 (six) months, with effect from 18th October 2022. The relevant organs of the party will within the period, meet to ratify the full recommendations of the disciplinary committee.</p><p>“You are advised to surrender all party’s documents and materials in your possession to the undersigned,” Ibrahim signed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FqZqWoXZi%2Fqr%2FIrGSyp6WptW64xJqbnqpdnLK1v4ysoLFlnaS7tbTSZqquq6Cau7S1zqdkqK6Vp3qiuMuenp6cXZu8s7PEq7Bo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./glass-onion-ending-explained.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Glass Onion' Introduces Fans to a New Mystery How Does It End?
