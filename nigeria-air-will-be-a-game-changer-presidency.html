In all eight years of President Muhammadu Buhari, there is no policy memo on anything that has done the zigzag that Nigerian Air has done.</p><p>“At least seven times, it came before the Federal Executive Council before finally it was let go.</p><p>“Just when everything was set and for the airline to start, domestic Nigerian airline operators went to court and they got an injunction that says that Nigeria Air must not fly. This held up everything until barely a week or two ago.”</p><p>While praising the minister of aviation for his doggedness in ensuring the airline becomes a reality, Shehu said many Nigerians will benefit from the project.</p><p>He said: “The minister has been bashed unfairly all over the place. He has been doing this, all of the commitment to put this airline in place but simply obstacles have been put on his part every inch of the way, until just a week or two ago when the thing was cleared for its resumption.</p><p>“I don’t blame him. He wants to make history, the minister wants to push for a new airline. So, it is honourable that he wants to kickstart it Friday, which is 24 hours from now. It would be to the relief of Nigerians, certainly, it is something that is going to be a game-changer, especially for international travel.”</p><p>The presidential spokesman said the collaboration with Ethiopian Airways is in the best interest of the country, adding that government is simply a bad manager of businesses.</p><p>He added, “This is entirely different because past attempts have been made to use resources from the treasury to run a business.</p><p>“Government is simply a bad manager of businesses. We would continue to fail so long as these things are run by the government.</p><p>“This realization is simply the fact that the government of Nigeria would be a minority shareholder in this enterprise, it is going to be essentially business run and that would mean that it would succeed.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZqeZmZ%2Bur7HWrGWcp51kf3F%2BkmhnbmdianyvtcaeqaKZXZa2s3nWoqOlZZKaeqJ5xpqknmWTna6vs8SrZKmqlai2pbHNnLBo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./416791-uhuru-kenyatta-goes-on-his-knees-pray-our-lady-protection-shrine-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kitui: Uhuru Kenyatta Goes On His Knees to Pray at Our Lady of Protection Shrine</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jodi-lyn-okeefe-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jodi Lyn O'Keefe - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
