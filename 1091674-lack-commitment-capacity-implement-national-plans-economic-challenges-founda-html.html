commitment, inadequate capacity of government institutions to implement development plans as largely responsible for economic challenges in the African region.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkyt718s6hjrtj2.jpeg><p class=align-left>The Executive Secretary of ACBF, Prof. Emmanuel Nnadozie, said this in Abuja on Friday.</p><p class=align-left>Nnadozie, an economist and a development expert, said the greatest challenge facing Nigeria at this time was the recession it found its self.</p><p class=align-left>He said there was no reason Nigeria should be in recession, given the robust nature of its development plans and visions over the years.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong>Get the latest news on Legit.ng News App</p><p class=align-left>He, however, said that the inability to fully implement the plans were part of the reasons for the current economic crunch in the country.</p><p class=align-left>Nnadozie said it was cheering that the government was putting together an economic recovery and growth programme to get the country out of the recession .</p><p class=align-left>According to him, Nigeria should be growing at double digit at this point in time.</p><p class=align-left><i>“It should not be in negative growth rate; this country should be doing at least 10 to 13 per cent growth rate,” </i>he said.</p><p class=align-left>He said it was important that Nigeria resorted to long term measures of development.</p><p class=align-left><i>“But we should not confuse this short term expansionary policy to address recession with the long term strategy for developing the country.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“ I have emphasised this long enough to say that this country has always had good plans and good strategies, weather it is vision 2020 or the national development strategies.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“Nigeria has always had good plans; It always had plans to diversify the economy, but the issue has always been to what extent has this nice strategic plans be implemented.”</i></p><p class=align-left>Nnadozie said that Nigeria made the mistake that many countries made by listening much to outsiders who it thought knew better than Nigerians.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Be holy to attract divine intervention, cleric urges Nigerians</p><p class=align-left>This, he said, resulted in successive governments abandoning well articulated policy documents designed to promote economic development and prosperity in the country.</p><p class=align-left>“<i>When you make a plan as individual and things don’t work as an individual, would you then throw away the plan.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“But what did we do on the continent, we throw away the plans made because people told us that the plan will not work.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“ The Asians never threw away their plans; from China to Malaysia, to Indonesia, to South Korea, none of them stops planning, even though they were advised to do the same thing that Africans were advised to do.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“ They continued with their development plans, but perfected it, continued to have leadership that enforced and make sure that it was implemented and look at where they are today.“</i></p><p class=align-left>According to him, whatever plan the managers of the nation’s economy will make to salvage the economy will not be different from the well formulated plans of the past.</p><p class=align-left>Nnadozie said it was important that managers of the economy be disciplined and consistent in the process of implementing whatever economic plans designed to salvage the economy.</p><p class=align-left><i>“ We need to have some where we are aiming to go and decide how best to get there.</i></p><p class=align-left><i>“In vision 2020, we had the strategies, but you can see that we have that and kept it aside and everybody is just doing something different; there is no discipline to follow the strategy put in place.</i></p><p class=align-left>According to him, the issue of non implementation of the various plans is not the challenge of money but the challenge of capacity.</p><p class=align-left><i>“The constraint is capacity; three types of capacity, one is the soft capacity, that is the leadership capacity, the mind set, the issues of values; the second one is the human capacity, then the critical skills that are needed.</i></p><p class=align-left>He said it was important that Nigerians in government and leadership positions developed the right capacity to drive development in the country.</p><p class=align-left><i>“We have thousands of educated Nigerians all over the world; how can they shine in other places and they don’t perform here in Nigeria.</i></p><p></p><p class=align-left><i>“It is not that it does not have the critical skills but some time, they are not allowed to contribute here.”</i></p><p class=align-left>He also said it was also important to strengthen the capacity of various institutions of government involved in implementing economic and development policies in the country.</p><p class=align-left>Source: NAN</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p
