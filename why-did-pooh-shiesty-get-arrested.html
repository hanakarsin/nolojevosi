While many people thought they knew why he was behind bars, some are still questioning what actually went down.</p><p>Why did Pooh Sheisty get arrested? Read on as we give you the rundown.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pooh Shiesty was arrested for an alleged connection to a Miami strip club shooting.</h2><p>Pooh Shiesty (real name: Lontrell Denell Williams Jr.)&nbsp; surrendered to Miami authorities on June 8, 2021, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC Miami</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The MC was detained by police due to an alleged connection to a shooting at King of Diamond, a popular Miami strip club, over Memorial Day weekend. The Miami-Dade Police Department had a warrant out for the rapper’s arrest on an aggravated battery charge, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Shade Room.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Making matters worse, one video showed Williams walking out of the strip club appearing to have a firearm in his possession. As you can imagine, the jury of public opinion was already out on whether or not the rapper is responsible for the crime.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Miami Herald</a> reported that Williams was suspected of shooting a security guard in the leg. The warrant claimed that the melee started when a security guard was escorting Williams out of the club. Someone allegedly knocked money out of the rapper’s pocket, and the crowd reportedly began trying to retrieve the cash.</p><p>In turn, this allegedly led to the rapper returning to the stage, where a security guard attempted to stop him from taking his gun out. But, shots rang out anyway.</p><p>And since videos of the shooting have gone viral on social media, the authorities likely used the footage as evidence.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pooh Shiesty's alleged gunshot victim recanted his testimony.</h2><p>On June 15, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> reported that Williams' attorneys filed a new motion with a sworn testimony from the victim — who claims he was given a powerful painkiller (Dilaudid) when he arrived at the hospital and was not aware of what he was telling a detective when the gave his initial statement.</p><p>According to the publication: "In this new account, Dor suggests the commotion in the club might have been caused by a fan (the spinning type, not a person) that fell in a parking garage nearby. He also says he doesn't recall Pooh aiming at him or even shooting at him."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This wasn't the first time Pooh Shiesty was arrested for allegedly being involved in a shooting.</h2><p>Unfortunately, this wasn't Williams' first rodeo with law enforcement. June 9 was the second time the rapper has been arrested due to allegedly having been involved in a shooting.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC Miami</a> reported that the 21-year-old was arrested in October 2020 in connection with a shooting in Bay Harbor Islands, Miami. He was booked and charged with armed robbery with a firearm, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon doing great bodily harm, aggravated assault with a firearm, and theft.&nbsp;</p><p>While the rapper had been out on bond after pleading not guilty, his latest arrest has the potential to work against him in the future. Since he is most recently facing a charge of aggravated battery, there's a great possibility that he may have to do time behind bars if convicted — but perhaps not, if the alleged victim stands by the recanting of his original statement.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pooh Shiesty Granted $10K bond for Strip Club Shooting charge but will remain in Jail until he faces the judge from his other Miami shooting case.</p>— DJ Akademiks (@Akademiks) <a href=#>June 9, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Although Williams was granted a $10,000 bond on charges from the strip club shooting, he had to remain behind bars until June 10, 2021, because the rapper had to see a judge in regard to his October 2020 shooting case.</p><p>When June 10 rolled around, Judge Venzer decided the rapper wouldn't be released because he had two open felony cases involving gun violence, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a> reported.
