Legendary comic book artist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">George Pérez</a>, who is responsible for the creation of several iconic comic book characters such as Starfire, Cyborg, Raven, and Deathstroke, died at age 67. George's work extends to both comic book powerhouses <a href=#>DC Comics</a> and <a href=#>Marvel Comics</a>, and he will be well-missed by the community.</p><p>What was George's cause of death? Here's everything we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What was George Pérez's cause of death?</h2><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, George's legacy in the comics industry is long and impactful. He began working for Marvel Comics at the age of 19 under Fantastic Four artist Rich Buckler, but quickly made his artist debut the next year in a story for "Astonishing Tales."</p><p>Since then, he has served not only as an artist but a creator or co-creator for many famous Marvel and DC superheroes, including White Tiger, Nightwing, Starfire, Raven, Deathstroke, Brother Blood, Bette Kane, Ravager, Cheetah, Cyborg, Blackfire, Silver Swan, Psimon, Iron Maiden, and more. In 1980, he penciled the art for "New Teen Titans" for five years, and it quickly became a breakout hit.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Arguably the biggest impact George held on comics is his revitalization of Wonder Woman, which he wrote and penciled until 1992. He is also responsible for giving a new origin story to a well-beloved Teen Titan Donna Troy/Wonder Girl in 1988. Director Patty Jenkins has stated that his vision for Wonder Woman was a key influence on her 2017 film.</p><p>George and frequent collaborator Marv Wolfman also crafted the highly influential "Crisis on Infinite Earths" 50th anniversary DC Comics series, which featured DC characters across the multiverse banding together to defeat the villainous Anti-Monitor. His cover of Superman mourning the death of Supergirl has become one of the most influential comic book covers of all time.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>George Pérez made everything look effortless. His contributions were pivotal in both driving and reinventing DC’s long and rich history. George’s stories were a joy to read, and his work resonated with everyone he met. He will be missed by those here at DC and fans worldwide. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/g8lMC62tK5</a></p>— DC (@DCComics) <a href=#>May 7, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>After departing DC for a time, George returned to Marvel and penciled the Infinity Gauntlet series, which later became the films Avengers: Endgame and Infinity War. In 1998, he also penciled The Avengers. In addition to being an excellent creative, he was also charitable and served as a member of The Hero Initiative, a charity dedicated to providing health and medical assistance for comic book professionals.</p><p>George announced his retirement in 2019, and it was revealed on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his Facebook page</a> in 2021 that he had been diagnosed with Stage 3 pancreatic cancer. He wrote in a December post that he had six months to live, and was opting not to pursue chemotherapy but to let "nature take its course." In a post on May 7, 2022, it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was announced</a> that George had passed away.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Comics fans and creatives across the globe mourn George's death. "George Pérez had an art style that was both dynamic and incredibly expressive,” DC Publisher and Chief Creative Officer Jim Lee said in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>. “His art was the perfect storytelling canvas for some of the most important events in DC history. While he will be sorely missed, his work will live on with a countless number of fans, as well as all the talent he’s influenced over the years."</p><p>A public memorial for George will take place in May during MegaCon Orlando, and the service will be open to the public. The artist is survived by his wife, Carol Flynn.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLKwvsaeZKmdoprHbq%2FArqqeZZ%2BbeqWxwK2f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./apc-others-lose-1000-members-to-pdp-in-bauchi.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>APC, Others Lose 1,000 Members To PDP In Bauchi</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-does-david-dobrik-make-per-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>This Is How Much David Dobrik Makes Per Video and It's More Than Some People's Salaries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
