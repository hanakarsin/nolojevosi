That being said, we were unsurprised when we heard the celebrity chef opted to adopt ‚Äî instead of shop ‚Äî for Bella.</p><p>"We will open our home and our hearts to another animal in need, because that is what Izzy would want," Rachael said in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a heartfelt tribute</a> after her late pit-bull, Isaboo, passed away in May. A few weeks later, they brought home Bella Boo Blue, whom she introduced to fans in a much cheerier <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a> on June 15.&nbsp;</p><p>"Happy Adoption Day to Bella Boo Blue who we welcome to our family today.

From watching Bella <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">keep busy playing with ice cubes</a>, to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">witnessing her heart-melting puppy naps</a>, spending time with a playful, blissfully unaware pup has definitely kept them sane.</p><p>And although it was definitely difficult for Rachael and John when their Warren County, N.Y. house burned down, we're sure Bella is helping them stay grounded. As previously mentioned, the trio made it out of their house safely.</p><p>‚ÄúRachael, her husband and their dog Bella are safe,‚Äù said Rachael's representative, Charlie Dougiello. While the damage is unknown, we're glad they all made it out together.</p><p>Rachael, John, and Bella are certainly a glorious trio. Between Isaboo's passing, the ongoing pandemic, and their house burning down, Bella has definitely brought tremendous joy to Rachael and John.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp66ktMCeo2aqka56r7HWZqeuqKCu</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-john-the-circle.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is 'The Circle's' John?
