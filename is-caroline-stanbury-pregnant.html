Find out if the reality star is pregnant.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@carolinestanbury</a></figure><p>When <a href=#>Caroline Stanbury</a> joined the cast of <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Dubai</a>, she agreed to let viewers in on many facets of her personal life. On the new Bravo series, she gives fans a peek into her career as a celebrity fashion stylist and podcaster while simultaneously juggling her home life. The Ladies of London alum is a mother of three children, whom she shares with her ex-husband, <a href=#>Cem Habib</a>.</p><p>Caroline also has a new man in her life, former soccer player <a href=#>Sergio Carrallo</a>. In 2021, the couple married two years after she separated from Cem. Sergio, 27, and Caroline, 46, have become a hot topic on RHODubai due to their 19-year age difference. But rather than avoid the truth, the lovebirds have opened up about the challenges of their age gap.</p><p>One of their most significant hurdles has been Sergio’s desire to have a baby with Caroline. But is the reality star welcoming another bundle of joy? Here’s what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@carolinestanbury</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Caroline Stanbury pregnant?</h2><p>Caroline and Sergio met in 2020 at an event for her podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Divorced, Not Dead</a>. After several months of getting to know each other, Sergio moved to Dubai from California to prove how serious he was about Caroline. In January 2021, the former college student proposed to his love, and they married that November. Caroline’s <a href=#>three children</a> — Yasmin, 16, and twin boys, Aaron and Zac, 12 — were in attendance for the big day.</p><p>Since their wedding, fans have wondered if Caroline and her husband will have a baby in the future. Although Sergio is her kids’ stepfather, he doesn’t have any children of his own — though he says he'd like to. However, Caroline isn’t pregnant and doesn’t plan to be anytime soon.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@carolinestanbury</a></figure><p>During a recent episode of RHODubai, she admitted to being nervous about carrying a child after the age of 40.</p><p>“I'm very scared to have to do this again," Caroline said in a confessional, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. "But if I can't have the baby, Sergio won't stay… Fact."</p><p>While Sergio never said he would leave his wife if she didn’t get pregnant again, he's seemingly adamant about conceiving a baby with her. When Caroline mentions surrogacy to him, he says he wouldn’t want to go that route because he wants the child to look like them.</p><p>According to Sergio, babies born through a surrogate look a little different from their biological parents, even though the couple uses their own sperm and egg. Sergio's comment left Caroline in disbelief.</p><p>“This is definitely where I see the age gap because he is clueless," she said on the show. "He just thinks two people have sex and a baby comes out."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by carolinestanbury (@carolinestanbury)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Caroline Stanbury’s kids don’t think she’s ready for another baby with Sergio Carallo.</h2><p>Caroline’s children also have some strong opinions about her getting pregnant again. In the same episode, she talked to Yasmine and told her Sergio wanted more kids. Yasmine rejected the idea, stating she’s perfectly fine with only having her twin siblings.</p><p>"You're not allowed to have another one," Yasmine said to Caroline. "I don't care what Sergio wants. There's like no world that you could ever convince me to have another sibling."</p><p>Yasmine shared that she doesn’t think they should have any more kids because Caroline isn’t doing the best job raising the three she already has. She then suggested the couple open their relationship up so that Sergio could have his baby without Caroline.</p><p>“On the kid front, you forget that you have three most of the time," Yasmine declared. "He can stay married to you and have a kid with someone else!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by carolinestanbury (@carolinestanbury)</a></p></figure><p>While Yasmine disagrees with the couple welcoming a new child, she doesn’t seem to mind her relationship with Sergio.
