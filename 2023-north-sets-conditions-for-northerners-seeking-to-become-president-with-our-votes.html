He has to convince us in the North that he understands our problems, and has the capacity to solve them. He must have the disposition, energy, health, and intelligence to heal the breached pluralism of the North and build bridges across the entire nation.</p><p>“He has to be able to lead a country that is failing in a number of significant areas. A personal ambition to be President will not be enough, and we will scrutinize and advise those who will listen, to avoid the temptation to put in place persons who just want power, but not responsibility.</p><p>“A president from the North must have the exposure and network to reintegrate all parts of Nigeria into one country and one vision. He must have the courage to eliminate threats of insurgents, bandits, kidnappers, irredentists, impunity, the drugs pandemic, and corruption.</p><p>“He must lead with a sense of mission and urgency; the wisdom to negotiate where necessary and the clout to hit hard where he needs to; and a clear understanding of the sources and nature of our threats and their solutions.</p><p>“The point must be made again that every Nigerian, irrespective of his political party or identity must be free to contest within his or her party to be fielded as a Presidential candidate, and we should reject any party that specifically and deliberately excludes any Nigerian from exercising the same right other Nigerians have,” Baba-Ahmed said.</p><p>While taking a swipe at the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, the NEF spokesman said it has dropped the ball in terms of insecurity, irredentism, corruption, poverty, national cohesion, unemployment of the young, and faith in the democratic process to become a way of life in Nigeria today.</p><p>He noted that with the unglorifying performance of the Buhari administration, which many mischievously see as solely a Northern creation, Northerners have come to appreciate that being Northern alone is not enough to make a good leader.</p><p>“The rest of Nigeria has a legitimate cause of concern when sections of the country that have become virtual hostages of irredentists, suggest that only when they have the Presidency will the country eliminate organized violence that has made massive inroads into lives of Nigerian citizens living there,” Baba-Ahmed said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5FyZmtoYmh6r7vRrZ9mq5WpwG6vzqeboqyZpLu0ecWoqWamn6fBqbHRp5yrq12osqa3yKeeZqyfYq%2Bmr86mnGaooprAqrDEp6tmr5mptW671Ktkr6ekmsBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-late-coas-attahirus-snub-national-award-ceremony.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Late COAS Attahiru's Family Snub National Award Ceremony</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-does-getting-zombied-mean-in-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Getting &amp;quot;Zombied&amp;quot; Is the Latest Way the Internet Can Ruin Your Dating Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
