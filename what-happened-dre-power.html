In case you need a recap, during Season 5, Dre and Ghost agreed to help each other out —&nbsp;Ghost would kill Diego Jimenez for Dre while Dre would kill Jason Micic for Ghost.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Dre is unable to kill Jason since Jason was given a heads up on the plan by Kanan (50 Cent). Fast forward, and Dre is snitching on Alicia Jimenez (Diego's sister and head of the Jimenez cartel), which puts him in danger and in way over his head.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Dre wanted the top spot, but it came at a price. #PowerTV drops August 25.

According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>, Dre is very much a recurring character during Season 6 — and his comeback cannot come soon enough for viewers.&nbsp;</p><p>"What happened to Dre on Power? He got out the game??" one fan tweeted before another wrote, "James St. Patrick (Ghost) was just innocent in this show, but everyone just want a piece of him, and where the hell is Dre (snitch)[sic]?"&nbsp;</p><p>A third chimed in, "They didn't show Dre on Power last night... I forgot we have to deal with that beef too."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This is going to be Dre's best season, according to Rotimi.&nbsp;</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In an interview on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Angie Martinez Show</a> earlier this year, Rotimi revealed that he was excited for fans to see Dre on the final season of Power.&nbsp;</p><p>"For me, personally, this is probably my favorite season of [Power] because you get to see the human side of [Dre], you see why he makes the decisions he makes," Rotimi explained. "You find out that all he literally does is for his daughter. So, he's in a lot of bad situations this season, and you see the vulnerability... I was able to get emotional. You meet a whole lot of different characters in Dre's life this year."&nbsp;</p><p>As for what happens between Dre and Ghost, as Rotimi put it, they "just don't get along."</p><p>"They mirror each other," Rotimi added of Dre and Ghost's dynamic. "He's the younger version of [Ghost]. He does everything that he does."</p><p>Watch Power Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on Starz. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnDq5xmqJ%2BssrM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ukraine-vs-russia-iran-alleges-who-should-be-blamed-for-war.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Iran Alleges Who Should Be Blamed For War</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./grocery-employee-items-wrong-spots.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Grocery Employee Documents All the Items Placed in the Wrong Spot Throughout Her Shift</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
