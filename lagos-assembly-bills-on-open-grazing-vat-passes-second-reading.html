This is in line with fiscal federalism that we have been talking about.”</p><p>The Assembly speaker said the VAT law when passed, would help the state meet challenges in its various sectors.</p><p>He also urged the Lagos State government to do everything legally possible to ensure the judgement of a Federal High Court, Port Harcourt, is sustained even up to the Supreme Court.</p><p>“It is an opportunity for us to emphasise again on the need for the consideration of true federalism,” he said.</p><p>Speaking earlier on the bill on open grazing, Hon. Bisi Yusuf (Alimosho 1), lamented the havoc that herdsmen had caused in the southwestern zone.</p><p>According to him, farmers have continuously become afraid to visit their farms thus causing shortage of food.</p><p>Hon Yusuf also said many farmers had become indebted as they now find it difficult to pay back loans they secured.</p><p>His position was supported by Hon. Kehinde Joseph (Alimosho 2) who said open grazing in the 21st century is an aberration.</p><p>Joseph said the bill would ensure peaceful coexistence, reduce crime and help to guide the activities of herders.</p><p>On his part, Hon. Olumoh Saad Lukeman (Ajeromi-Ifelodun 1), suggested that the high court should be made to handle cases from the enforcement of the bill when passed or that the state should establish special courts for such purpose.</p><p>Hon. Tobun Abiodun (Epe 1) said it was common to see cattle going to school as if they want to learn while Hon. David Setonji (Badagry 2), recalled “a time we went on oversight function in a school here in Lagos. We were embarrassed by cattle. We had to wait for the herder to move the cattle before we embarked on our oversight function.”</p><p>Other lawmakers who contributed during plenary include Hon. Adedamola Richard Kasunmu, Hon. Rasheed Makinde and Hon. Sanni Okanlawon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e49vZqWZl6TAbq3SrJymmpyueqO1y6WqZqeeYryxsc1mnquZqp67qHnVmqtmqJGowKa%2FjKycnKeemXqzscCdoKefXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-does-getting-zombied-mean-in-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Getting &amp;quot;Zombied&amp;quot; Is the Latest Way the Internet Can Ruin Your Dating Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./burt-young-cause-of-death.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Was 'Rocky' Star Burt Young's Cause of Death?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
