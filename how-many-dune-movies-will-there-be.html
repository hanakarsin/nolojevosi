At least two.</h2><p>Warner Bros. Dune is called "Part 1," but the sequel wasn't officially greenlit by the studio before the movie's release. Because the movie has become so popular, we're now officially going to get a part two. But there are 21 books that make up the Dune Universe, so we could also potentially be getting a lot more movies.</p><p>The Dune saga has sold a whopping 20 million copies. It's been translated into a bunch of different languages, so naturally, production studios and screenwriters have dreamt of expanding the franchise's film audience.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Warner Bros.</span></figure><p>David Lynch's 1984 Dune film with Sting was a massive flop, but cinephiles swear up and down that the director's cut was actually a sprawling masterpiece that was ruined by production decisions.</p><p>Villeneuve's Dune doesn't try to reconcile the series' entire story in a two-hour and 35-minute run-time, which is why it's so successful.</p><p>Luckily, fans have flocked to the movie. It managed to pull in $5.1 million in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMAX theaters on Thursday night early openings</a>, not bad considering most movies aren't generating the kind of money they did in theaters prior to the pandemic. Its performance so far was enough for Part 2 to be greenlit.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is the 'Dune: Part 2' release date?</h2><p>Since March of 2018, Denis stated that he planned on making Dune a two-parter, but Part 2 wasn't actually greenlit until after Part 1 proved to be a box office success. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Dune: Part 2 will hit theaters on Oct. 20, 2023.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>When someone asks me what DUNE is about <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/h2XZ103LzU</a></p>— Tom Zohar (@TomZohar) <a href=#>October 22, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter | @TomZohar</span></figure><p>“The story in itself sets up for a sequel," said Ann Sarnoff, chair and CEO of WarnerMedia Studio and Networks Group in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Variety</a>. "The production is so amazing and the storytelling is so compelling that it’s not going to be judged on box office alone."</p><p>But waiting to make and release Dune: Part 2 was not the original plan for its director. "I wanted at the beginning to do the two parts simultaneously, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Villeneuve said to Variety</a>. "For several reasons, it didn’t happen, and I agreed to the challenge of making part one and then wait to see if the movie rings enough enthusiasm. … As I was doing the first part, I really put all my passion into it, in case it would be the only one. But I’m optimistic."</p><p>His optimism has clearly paid off.</p><p>You can watch Dune: Part 1 in theaters now and on HBO Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecyapbJllKq7pnnMqK2inaNixKq4y2aroZ2imnqjsQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nigerian-man-shot-dead-in-ghana-after-stabbing-police-officers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nigerian Man Shot Dead In Ghana After Stabbing Police Officers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tinder-math-personality-test.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Guy's Tinder Profile Is a &amp;quot;Douchey&amp;quot; Math Quiz That Tests a Woman's Personality</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
