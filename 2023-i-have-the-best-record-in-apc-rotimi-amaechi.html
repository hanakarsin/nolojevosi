Gen. Tukur Buratai.</h2><p>The Nigeria Ambassador to the Republic of Benin on Wednesday pleaded with delegates of the All Progressives Congress in Bauchi to support Amaechi.</p><p>Buratai noted that he was stirred to support the presidential ambition of the former minister due to his profile and experience in governance.</p><p>The former COAS said, “You can see from the introduction, the experience of our Presidential aspirant. The profile of Rt Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi is quite intimidating. He has proven to be a sound administrator, a versatile leader, a good strategist and a politician par excellence, who has shown good qualities in all areas he had worked.</p><p>“As Speaker, as Governor, as Minister and also first among equals during his tenure as Chairman of Nigeria Governors’ Forum, as well as the dexterity and the quality of the campaign (for President Buhari) that he led on two occasions. That is why I am giving him my full support.</p><p>“He did that diligently with all his determination, loyalty and of course with love for Nigeria and love for humanity irrespective of what religion you belong to. This is quite commendable, that’s why he’s here today to solicit your votes. From what you have heard about him, I believe you know that he’s the man of the moment. He is the right choice. So, I urge you to make the right choice and vote for him.”</p><p>Amaechi while addressing delegates said he is the only aspirant in the party with impressive records that would defeat the opposition party.</p><p>He said, “This is the moment of decision. For 22 years, I have held public office, as Speaker, a governor and a Minister. And in all of these, you will see my footprint. There’s a railway construction going on from Port Harcourt to Maiduguri. It includes Bauchi and it’s called the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri railway. If you vote for me, that project will be completed and it will create employment. So vote for me, make me the candidate of the party. I doubt that the other aspirants can defeat me, If you vote for me I will defeat PDP.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5ByZmtoYmh6qnnHmq2eZaSdsm6uxKyrZqqVmLyzsIyipWaZoJh6s7vToqSiZZGirqavx6Jm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./327021-dadake-diamond-queen-darleen-akana-madai-kuwa-ni-mjamzito-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dadake Diamond Queen Darleen akana madai kuwa ni mjamzito</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./victoria-roman-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Victoria Roman - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
