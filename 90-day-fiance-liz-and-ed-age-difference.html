At the time, things weren't super serious and things sort of fizzled out. There was even a time when fans were sure Liz had ulterior motives for being with Ed, a reality star.</p><p>But now, in Season 7 of <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?</a>, they're engaged and their age difference may be their next hurdle to face as a couple.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In the Oct. 2 episode, Liz's grandparents express concern over their age difference. And they aren't totally wrong to have some thoughts about it. Ed's own daughter is close to Liz's age on 90 Day Fiancé. Will this be the thing to drive the wedge between them that will finally split them up? That's doubtful, but it's definitely a thing right now.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Liz and Ed's age difference on '90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?'</h2><p>Fans have always been aware of the age difference between Liz and Ed, even if Ed has always seemed just a tad younger than his years, thanks to his behavior with women on the show. Right now, Ed is 57 years old, while Liz is 29.</p><p>Sure, that makes Liz a consenting adult. She even has a young daughter from a previous relationship. But the age gap also means Ed is old enough to be his bride-to-be's father.</p><p>On 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?, Liz's grandmother asks Ed, "Are you marrying her because you really, really, really love her? Or is it because she makes you feel young?"</p><p>Although Ed insists that he genuinely loves Liz, his words aren't enough to satisfy her grandparents. Or enough to totally diminish their worries.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Liz's grandfather also poses the concern about Liz taking care of her much older husband when they are both older, years down the line. Liz is up for the challenge, though, because she loves Ed that much. But their age difference continues to be a topic of conversation for both sides of their families.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened between Liz and Ed before they got engaged?</h2><p>Viewers have watched drama play out between the couple both on and off TV for the past couple of years. But the biggest issues have been off-camera. In 2021, a leaked <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recorded phone call</a> surfaced, during which Ed was verbally abusive to Liz and called her "stupid" and "f-cked up in the head" for giving a co-worker a ride home. Ed, who is prone to jealousy, gave Liz reluctant "permission" to drive her co-worker home after work.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>At the time, fans were sure the phone call meant Liz and Ed were over. But clearly, with their engagement, things are far from finished with the couple.</p><p>However, even now, on the show, Liz admits that Ed can be controlling and jealous because of his own insecurities, though she's still with him. Liz and Ed's age difference may be yet another issue for them, but it's definitely not the only one.</p><p>Watch 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? on Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfbn1usMCyZJ%2BhkaOwpnnLorFmmZ6ZeqawjJqenmWUnrOnsdGepZyd</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./delta-coca-cola-napkins.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Delta Cancels Coca Cola Campaign Encouraging Passengers to Hit on Each Other</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jean-luc-bilodeau-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jean-Luc Bilodeau - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
