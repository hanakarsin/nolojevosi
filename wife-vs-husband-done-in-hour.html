Growing up, I used to watch a lot of reruns at my grandmother's house. I was particularly fond of Lucy from <a href=#>I Love Lucy</a>, Donna Stone from The Donna Reed Show, and Samantha from <a href=#>Bewitched</a>. Each of these women portrayed a different kind of mother, and I adored them for a variety of reasons. One thing they all had in common was the fact that they were stay-at-home moms.</p><p>This makes sense as these shows began in the 1950s and '60s. That dynamic became less and less common as time and feminism marched on, and thank goodness for it. I mostly enjoyed the comedic aspect of these shows, and the fact that these women were quite funny. I never clocked the work they did at home, but I recognized it was important. This is why one <a href=#>TikTok</a> about what a wife does in an hour versus what her husband does really has my knickers in a bunch.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>(L-R): Donna Reed as Donna Stone, Lucille Ball as Lucy Ricardo, and Elizabeth Montgomery as Samantha Stevens</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This guy should have helped his wife.</h2><p>Ivan, who goes by @IvanGtv on TikTok, snagged a video a woman shared about what she does between the hours of 5 and 6 p.m. versus what her husband does. It's pretty enraging. Hint: He does nothing.</p><p>It comes across as a little performative, but that doesn't mean this isn't her actual life. As the woman, who I am calling Linda, literally stands over a hot stove making dinner, she yawns. Again, that part could be for show, but that doesn't take away from the fact that she is 100 percent doing this on her own. That's not a bit!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@ivangtv href=#>@ivangtv</a><p>Internet is telling this woman to divorce her husband. <a title=divorce href=#>#divorce</a> <a title=parentsoftiktok href=#>#parentsoftiktok</a> <a title=momsoftiktok href=#>#momsoftiktok</a> <a title=dadsoftiktok href=#>#dadsoftiktok</a> <a title=fypシ href=#>#fypシ</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - IvanGtv" href=#>♬ original sound - IvanGtv</a></figure><p>A child appears by Linda's legs and needs comforting. The dinner preparation has been changed from both hands to one hand while she picks up her daughter and sits her on one hip.</p><p>Occasionally Linda needs both hands to wrap around her daughter's back, as she throws her arms around her mother's neck. Some classic mom rocking from side-to-side ensues.</p><p>At some point, in text over the video, Linda writes that she has "considered running away" but opts to "laugh instead of cry." If only there were other options, like a whole other adult human being who could take on some of these tasks. The last thing we see is Linda's husband lounging on the couch, on his phone.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@IvanGtv (screenshot)</a><p>It's a very full-time job.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The comments section is the stuff of nightmares.</h2><p>Without knowing anything about their relationship, several people assumed that this man just got home from a very long shift and as such deserves to relax. It's wild to watch people build entire stories about two strangers with zero information. They're doing a lot of mental gymnastics in order to justify why this man is so selfish.</p><p>More than one person has unfairly described what the husband does as "real work" and what the wife does as "not work." It's wild to think that this woman is expected to take care of a house and child all day, only to continue doing it once her husband gets home. And if it isn't work, then why isn't he helping? If it's so fun and easy, why is he on his arse?</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>In classic social media style, the comments section has been built on narratives people have created and are then responding to. For example, the question, "Why didn't she ask for help," was asked multiple times. It's very telling that these folks assumed she didn't. And while I'm of the mind that people should always share what their needs are, is expecting someone to help with a dinner they are about to eat something one needs to convey?</p><p>And don't get me started on the child and the way so many men frame spending time with them as "babysitting." Now, we don't know if that's what this man thinks, but if he truly has had a long day at work like so many commenters believe, shouldn't he want to hang out with his daughter? I hope he saw that TikTok and it birthed a change. I also hope we never know why his bare feet were blurred out. I don't need to know what's going on under there.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLansYyvqmagpaivorrDZpuoppVitq95x6isqw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./338163-tanzaniatakriban-watu-20-waangamia-wakingangania-mafuta-ya-upako-kanisani-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Upako wa mauti: Watu 20 wafariki dunia wakikimbilia mafuta ya pasta</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./juventus-cristiano-ronaldo-becomes-footballs-first-billionaire.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Juventus Cristiano Ronaldo Becomes Football's First Billionaire</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./breaking-court-of-appeal-defers-judgement-on-uche-secondus-versus-pdp.html>Court Of Appeal Defers Judgement On Uche Secondus Versus PDP</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-daenerys-targaryen-barren-pregnant.html>Daenerys Targaryen Thinks She Can't Get Pregnant And She Might Be Wrong</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./tiny-hand-and-feet-manicure.html>Tiny Hand And Feet Manicures Are A Thing And People Are Horrified</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./295027-top-10-adventure-movies-time-html.html>Top 10 adventure movies of all time</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-us-vietnamese-grandfather.html>A Recent Episode of 'This Is Us' Shed Light on New Aspects of Laurel's Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoBlog.
