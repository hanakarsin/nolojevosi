This signals an existential threat to the soulless, precipice-bound bunch of pretenders masquerading as a political party.</p><p>“The PDP had earlier informed Nigerians, especially intending aspirants on the platform of the APC that the APC became legally non-operational when on December 8, 2020, it dissolved its National, State as well as Local Government structures and handed its affairs over to an illegal body.</p><p>“Moreover, the PDP informs such aspirants that the widespread intractable infighting for the soul of the defunct APC by ferocious ‘political warlords’ is not for election purposes but in desperation for the control of APC structures as pedestals to further pillage public fund before and during the elections.</p><p>“The PDP calls on Nigerians to note that the APC by its actions has commenced an inevitable descent into self-inflicted political extinction.</p><p>“We call on Nigerians to remain alert and hopeful as our party takes decisive steps to democratically take over governance in 2023 in our mission to Rescue and Rebuild our nation from the rudderless, vicious, clueless and visionless APC.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5BqZqmcoGK6sK%2FKrGSaqJNivLex0Wagp52TqHqltdKsmKmqn6uurXnOn2SnmaSevK%2Bty2aaqKammru1tc6nZKedk2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./r-kelly-ex-drea.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>R.
